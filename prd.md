Design a Ticketmaster-class Ticketing Platform with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Native iOS/Android

1. System Architecture

Overview: The platform is designed with a domain-driven, clean architecture to handle high-demand ticket sales (on-sales) with extreme reliability. We decompose the system into clear bounded contexts – Seating, Ordering, Payments, and Catalog/Layouts – each encapsulating specific sub-domains. The goal is to ensure low latency, high throughput, and strong consistency for critical operations (like seat locking and order processing), while leveraging caching and distribution for read-heavy workloads (event and seating info).

Bounded Contexts and Interactions (DDD)
	•	Catalog/Layouts: Manages venues, events (shows), and static seat layouts. It stores venue layouts (seat maps) as immutable JSON documents in MongoDB. Once a layout is published (ready for use in an on-sale) or deployed (actively in use), it becomes read-only. This context provides seat map data to other contexts but does not handle availability or transactions.
	•	Seating: Handles seat inventory state and lifecycle. Responsible for seat availability status per event (available, on hold, reserved, sold, etc.), seat locking and TTL management, and ensuring consistency (no double booking). It enforces business rules like “one seat can be held by only one user at a time” and coordinates with Ordering when a hold is turned into a reservation.
	•	Ordering: Manages the ticket purchasing workflow. It includes Order creation, line items (tickets), attaching payment references (Stripe PaymentIntent), and order state transitions (from draft to confirmed, canceled, etc.). It relies on Payments context for processing payment confirmations and on Seating to lock/release seats during checkout.
	•	Payments: Integrates with external payment providers (Stripe initially, but abstracted via a StripePort for pluggability). It handles receiving and verifying webhooks (e.g. payment successful events), updating orders upon payment confirmation, and ensuring exactly-once processing of these events via an outbox mechanism.

These contexts interact through well-defined interfaces (e.g., Seating provides a SeatLockService for Ordering to use; Ordering emits domain events consumed by Payments context’s outbox worker, etc.). In a clean architecture style, the domain layer of each context is independent of frameworks, with interactions orchestrated in the application layer.

Clean Architecture Layers

Each bounded context is implemented with layered architecture:
	•	Domain Layer: Contains the core business logic, entities (aggregates like Order, Seat), value objects, and domain services. This layer is independent of any external tech (no direct database or network calls).
	•	Application Layer: Orchestrates use cases (application services) by invoking domain logic and coordinating between contexts. For example, an OrderService.CreateOrder use case will call Seating.HoldSeats, then create an Order aggregate, then call Payments.StripePort to create a payment intent. It uses ports (interfaces) to interact with infrastructure.
	•	Infrastructure Layer: Implements the ports with actual tech: e.g., a PostgresOrderRepository, RedisSeatLockRepository, MongoLayoutRepository, StripeApiClient. This layer also configures transaction management and cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth).
	•	Interface Layer (API): Exposes the functionality via HTTP APIs (REST, documented by OpenAPI). This layer handles HTTP <-> application layer translation, authentication, authorization, and input validation.

Logical Architecture Diagram: The diagram below shows how clients interact with the API and how a request flows through the system and into the infrastructure (datastores, external services):

Physical deployment: Initially, we may deploy on a platform like Fly.io for convenience (which provides global load balancing and multi-region app instances out of the box). Eventually, we will migrate to AWS for enterprise scale. On AWS, we’ll use services such as Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL), Amazon ElastiCache (Redis), and either MongoDB Atlas or self-managed Mongo on EC2/EKS for seat maps. The application will run in containers (e.g., ECS or Kubernetes on EKS) behind an Application Load Balancer. Static content (seat map JSON or images) will be distributed via CloudFront (CDN). This setup remains cloud-agnostic: we avoid proprietary services so that moving from Fly.io to AWS is mostly configuration changes (e.g., swapping connection strings).

Multi-Region Strategy

We target 99.95%+ availability with multi-region redundancy:
	•	Active-Passive (Short Term): In early phases, we’ll run a primary region (e.g., AWS us-east-1) serving all traffic, with a warm standby region (e.g., us-west-2) for disaster recovery. Data is replicated (for Postgres, using streaming replication or Aurora global database; for Mongo, using multi-region replica set; for Redis, perhaps backup or use AWS Global Datastore if needed for cross-region cache state, though locks are not replicated). Failover can be done via DNS switch or using Route53 health-based routing if the primary goes down.
	•	Active-Active (Phase 3 Goal): Longer-term, we plan active-active across regions to reduce latency and share load. Sharding strategy: We could partition events or tenants by region (for example, events happening in Europe served from an EU region, US events in a US region). Each region runs its own stack with its own DB cluster for its shard of data, reducing cross-region coordination. Global routing (via DNS or an edge proxy) directs users to the correct region based on event/tenant or user location. For truly global events where all regions need to participate, we may use a single “home” region for that event’s inventory to avoid split-brain scenarios.
	•	Data Residency: The design can accommodate data residency requirements by configuring certain tenants or events to specific regions. PII can be kept in region as needed. For example, EU customers’ data can be kept in EU-based clusters to meet GDPR, while still using a global CDN and edge network for static assets.
	•	DNS and Edge Routing: We employ a global DNS load balancer (like AWS Route53) with latency-based or geo-based routing, sending clients to the nearest healthy region. Static seat map content is on a CDN with edge nodes globally, so initial venue layout loads are fast. For dynamic API calls, clients hit the global DNS which routes to the appropriate regional load balancer. In case of a regional outage, DNS can fail over clients to another region (in active-passive). In active-active, if one region is overloaded or fails, other regions can temporarily take some overflow in a degraded mode (perhaps read-only for certain operations or a queuing mechanism, described later).

By separating concerns into bounded contexts, enforcing clean APIs between them, and planning for multi-region deployment, the system architecture balances strong consistency where needed (within a region for ordering and seat inventory) and eventual consistency or duplication where acceptable (e.g., duplicated read data like seat maps in multiple regions). All external interactions (Stripe, CDN) are designed to be robust to network issues (with retries, idempotency, and outbox patterns as described below).

2. Domain Model & FSMs

The core domain entities and their finite state machines (FSMs) ensure tickets cannot be double-booked and orders follow a valid lifecycle. Here are the key aggregates/entities and their behaviors:
	•	VenueLayout – Catalog context: Represents the seating layout of a venue (sections, rows, seat positions). It contains a collection of Seat definitions (each with static properties like section, row, number, and perhaps coordinates for display). This is stored in MongoDB as an immutable document once deployed. It has states like Draft (editable), Published (officially finalized, no more edits), and Deployed (actively used for sales). A Show (event) will reference a VenueLayout.
	•	Seat – Seating context: Represents a seat instance for a specific show (event). Since multiple shows can happen in the same venue, each show has its own instances of seats referencing the VenueLayout’s seats. A Seat’s state changes during the on-sale process (detailed in FSM below). Key fields: seat ID, show ID (or a composite key), current status/state, and a version number for concurrency control (optimistic locking). The seat does not directly know about orders or payments; it just knows if it’s free or reserved and possibly which order it’s reserved for.
	•	SeatHold – Seating context: A transient record representing a temporary hold on one or more seats by a user. When a user selects seats and initiates checkout, the system places a hold (lock) on those seats for a short time (TTL). The hold has an expiration time. We primarily track holds via Redis locks (for speed), but we can also represent an active hold in the domain as an object linking a user (or session) to the seats and an expiry. (This might not be a persisted aggregate – could be an in-memory/Redis concept – but it’s part of the domain logic to enforce TTLs).
	•	SeatLockVersion – Seating context: This is essentially the version or fencing token for a seat’s lock. In the implementation, it could be a field in the Seat record or a separate Postgres table that tracks the last version used for locking each seat. Each time a seat is locked or its state changes, the version increments. This is used to implement fenced locking (explained in Section 4) to avoid stale updates.
	•	Order – Ordering context: The aggregate for a ticket purchase order. An Order typically contains the customer (user) info, the list of seats (tickets) being purchased (as OrderLines), pricing, and payment status. It has a state machine from initial creation to completion:
	•	Draft: Order is created but not yet finalized (maybe the user’s cart before initiating payment). In our flow, we might skip a long-lived “cart” and go straight to pending payment once seats are selected.
	•	PendingPayment: Order has been created and associated with a payment intent, awaiting payment confirmation. The seats in the order are now considered reserved for this order.
	•	Confirmed: Payment succeeded (tickets are paid for and the order is finalized).
	•	Canceled: The order was voluntarily canceled (e.g., user changed mind before payment or an admin canceled it).
	•	Expired: Payment was not completed in time (payment intent expired or hold TTL passed without completion).
	•	Refunded: Payment was confirmed but later refunded (this would be a terminal state similar to canceled, but after confirmation).
	•	OrderLine – Ordering context: A line item within an Order, typically representing one ticket (seat) being purchased. Fields: order_id, seat_id (or seat reference), price, status. OrderLines might not have a complex FSM individually; they generally inherit the Order’s state (e.g., if the order is canceled, all lines are canceled).
	•	PaymentIntentRef – Payments context / Ordering: A value object linking an Order to an external payment. For Stripe, this would hold the Stripe PaymentIntent ID (and perhaps client secret or status). We store this in the Order for reference. Its “state” is essentially whether it’s awaiting, succeeded, or failed, but we rely on Stripe’s webhook events instead of managing a complex state machine inside our system for payments.

Seat State Machine (Seating)

Seats progress through several states to ensure a strict purchase lifecycle:

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Available
    Available --> OnHold : hold seats (lock acquired)
    OnHold --> Available : hold expired or released
    OnHold --> Reserved : order created (before payment)
    Reserved --> Paid : payment confirmed
    Reserved --> Available : payment failed or order canceled
    Paid --> [*] : order complete (ticket sold)

	•	Available: The seat is free for anyone to select.
	•	OnHold (Locked): The seat is temporarily held by a user (not available to others) pending checkout. This state is tracked primarily via Redis (fast in-memory lock with TTL). The system may not explicitly persist “OnHold” in the database for every seat (to avoid constant DB writes during a frantic on-sale), but conceptually, it’s a state. If needed, a field in Postgres (seat_status) could mark it, but typically we trust the Redis lock + version mechanism and treat any seat with an active lock as unavailable.
	•	Reserved: The user holding the seat has proceeded to create an Order (meaning they’re committing to buy, and a payment is initiated). At this point, we persist in Postgres that the seat is reserved for that order. This typically involves an update like seat.status = 'RESERVED', seat.order_id = X in the database within the order creation transaction.
	•	Paid: The order completed successfully (payment captured). The seat is now sold. We might mark the seat’s status as “SOLD” or “PAID” in the DB (or we could consider that equivalent to a final RESERVED state that implies paid, but better to have a distinct final state). After reaching Paid, the seat will no longer appear in any availability queries.
	•	From Reserved, if payment fails or doesn’t arrive in time, the system will release the reservation (cancel the order) and revert the seat to Available (making it purchasable by others again). Similarly, if a hold times out without an order, the seat goes back to Available.

Invariants: A seat can be associated with at most one active Order (i.e., cannot be reserved by two orders). A seat cannot go directly from Available to Paid without first being OnHold->Reserved (ensuring proper flow). State transitions must obey the FSM: e.g., you cannot reserve a seat that isn’t OnHold by you, you cannot pay for an order that isn’t pending, etc. These rules are enforced with checks in the domain layer and database constraints where possible.

Transaction Boundaries: Key transitions are done within DB transactions to maintain consistency:
	•	Acquiring a seat hold: involves both Redis (lock) and possibly a quick Postgres update (version bump). This is done atomically such that either a client successfully holds all requested seats or none (no partial holds).
	•	Creating an order: done in a single transaction – it writes the Order and OrderLines to Postgres, marks the seats as reserved (updates seat status in Postgres) and links them to the order, and also records a PaymentIntent reference. This all-or-nothing ensures we don’t have an Order without reserved seats or vice versa.
	•	Confirming payment (via webhook outbox): when a payment success event comes, updating the Order to confirmed and the seat to paid happens in one transaction (including writing an audit log entry). If that transaction fails or is rolled back, the system will retry via outbox (so we either get a fully confirmed order or we keep it pending and retry – no half-done updates).

Idempotency & Replay Rules: We implement idempotency for external-facing actions and incoming events:
	•	API calls that create resources (like hold seats, create order) accept an Idempotency-Key header. The system (via Redis or a DB table) will ensure that processing the same key twice does not duplicate the action. For example, if a client times out and retries a POST /orders with the same key, they will get the same order (or the second call will detect the first already succeeded).
	•	The stripe webhook events carry a unique event ID. We store these in the stripe_events table with a unique constraint, so the same event (replayed by Stripe or accidentally sent twice) is processed only once.
	•	Domain logic itself is designed to be idempotent where possible. A transition from PendingPayment to Confirmed will check if the order is already confirmed or canceled to avoid invalid state changes on replays.
	•	Replay of seat holds: if a client tries to hold an already held seat (without knowing), they’ll get a specific error (409 Conflict with code like STALE_LOCK or “Seat already taken”). They can then fetch fresh availability. Similarly, releasing a seat that isn’t held by you is a no-op or error, which prevents double releases.

In summary, the domain model ensures each seat and order moves through a well-defined life cycle, maintaining data integrity. The combination of in-memory locks (for speed) with DB-backed state (for reliability) plus careful transaction management and idempotency guarantees gives us both performance and consistency.

3. Data Schemas

Our primary data stores are PostgreSQL (for transactional data and source of truth) and MongoDB (for seat map documents), with Redis for transient data (locks, cache, sessions). Below are the key schemas and how they fulfill the domain needs:

PostgreSQL Schema (Relational Core Data)

We use PostgreSQL for all critical business data that requires transactions, consistency, and complex querying (orders, seats, users, etc.). Key tables:
	•	users – Stores user accounts (if needed for authentication/authorization), including tenant org info and roles. (Not detailed here, but includes fields: id (UUID), email, password_hash or external OAuth ID, etc., plus roles and tenant scope.)
	•	orders – Stores orders. Each order links to a user and possibly an organization (tenant). Key fields:
	•	id UUID PRIMARY KEY (could use ULID for sortable unique IDs).
	•	user_id UUID NOT NULL (who is buying; foreign key to users).
	•	status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL (e.g., ‘DRAFT’, ‘PENDING_PAYMENT’, ‘CONFIRMED’, ‘CANCELED’, etc.).
	•	payment_intent_id TEXT UNIQUE (Stripe PaymentIntent reference, if any; unique so two orders can’t reference the same payment).
	•	total_amount NUMERIC(10,2) and currency, etc. (We may also store breakdown or calculate from order_lines).
	•	Timestamps: created_at, updated_at. Possibly expires_at for how long we hold the order before expiration (which could be equal to seat hold TTL or PaymentIntent expiration).
	•	tenant_id or event_id for multi-tenant or linking to which show the order is for (if one order is for one event).
	•	Indexes: primary key, index on user_id (to query a user’s orders), unique index on payment_intent_id (only one order per Stripe intent), perhaps partial index ensuring payment_intent_id IS NOT NULL uniqueness.

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    event_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES events(id),
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    payment_intent_id TEXT UNIQUE,
    total_amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
    currency CHAR(3) DEFAULT 'USD',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
    -- ... other fields like billing info if needed
);

	•	order_lines – Stores individual ticket lines for an order. Fields:
	•	id UUID PK,
	•	order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
	•	seat_id UUID (or composite of event+seat number, references the seat instance),
	•	price NUMERIC(10,2),
	•	status VARCHAR(20) (could mirror order’s status or more granular like ‘REFUNDED’ per ticket if partial refund),
	•	possibly ticket_type (e.g., adult/child or VIP, etc., if applicable).
	•	Index on order_id (to quickly fetch all lines for an order).

CREATE TABLE order_lines (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    order_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    seat_id UUID NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(order_id, seat_id)  -- one seat per order, uniqueness to avoid duplicates
);

	•	events (shows) – Each event or show that has tickets. Fields include id, name, date, venue_id, layout_id, status (onsale, ended, etc.), tenant_id if multi-tenant, and possibly a flag if it’s active for sale. This links to a venue and a seat layout. We mention this for context (the Catalog context).
	•	seats / seat_inventory – We need to represent each seat’s availability per event. There are a couple of ways:
	1.	Seat Instances Table: A table event_seats with one row per seat per event:
	•	event_id, seat_label (or seat_layout_id reference), status, current_order_id (nullable), version.
	•	This is straightforward but could be very large (e.g., 50k seats * many events).
	•	However, it gives an easy way to query availability (WHERE event_id = X AND status = 'AVAILABLE').
	2.	Seat Lock/Version Table: Keep a lighter table just for lock versions and use layout reference for static info:
	•	E.g., seat_lock_version(event_id, seat_id, version, reserved_order_id NULL) and a separate static seat table for seat definition (section, row, etc).
	•	For quick locking, we might not update status to ‘LOCKED’ in DB (to avoid write storms), but we will update version.

Given the scale, we lean towards storing seat state in Postgres for reserved/sold states, and using Redis only for the short OnHold state. So:
	•	seat_inventory (or event_seats):
	•	event_id UUID (part of PK or separate with seat_id as PK? We can use a composite PK (event_id, seat_id) since seat_id might be unique per venue).
	•	seat_id UUID (or if seat numbering is not globally unique, could use an internal ID per seat).
	•	status VARCHAR(20) – ‘AVAILABLE’, ‘RESERVED’, ‘SOLD’. (We might not explicitly mark ‘LOCKED’ here; locked seats remain marked available until reserved, to avoid constant status churn.)
	•	order_id UUID – if reserved or sold, the order holding it (null if available).
	•	version BIGINT – monotonic version for fencing. Initialize at 0.
	•	Indices on (event_id, status) for availability queries, and (event_id, seat_id) as PK. Also an index on order_id to find all seats under an order (useful when finalizing or canceling an order to update seats).

CREATE TABLE event_seats (
    event_id UUID NOT NULL,
    seat_id UUID NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'AVAILABLE',
    order_id UUID,
    version BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY(event_id, seat_id)
);

	•	seat_lock_version (alternative design): If we want to separate locks from status, we could have a table that just stores the latest version for each seat:

CREATE TABLE seat_lock_version (
    event_id UUID NOT NULL,
    seat_id UUID NOT NULL,
    version BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY(event_id, seat_id)
);

And use this in transactions to check versions. However, maintaining version in event_seats as above might suffice (we can update version whenever status changes or whenever a lock is acquired).
	•	stripe_events (outbox) – Stores incoming Stripe webhook events for durable processing:
	•	event_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY (the ID from Stripe, globally unique per event).
	•	type VARCHAR (event type, e.g., payment_intent.succeeded).
	•	payload JSONB (raw event data if needed for debugging).
	•	processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE.
	•	received_at TIMESTAMP.
	•	Index on processed (to fetch unprocessed events quickly).

CREATE TABLE stripe_events (
    event_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB,
    processed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    received_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

	•	order_audit_log – Immutable log of significant order state changes (for debugging and compliance):
	•	id BIGSERIAL PK,
	•	order_id UUID,
	•	event_type VARCHAR (e.g., ‘STATUS_CHANGE’, ‘PAYMENT_ATTEMPT’, ‘REFUND_ISSUED’),
	•	from_status VARCHAR, to_status VARCHAR (for status changes),
	•	timestamp TIMESTAMP,
	•	possibly user_id or system actor who made the change, notes etc.
	•	This table can grow large but is append-only; we might archive or move to a data warehouse later. Index by order_id for quick retrieval.
	•	sessions/refresh_tokens – If using JWT access and opaque refresh tokens stored in Redis, we might not need a DB table for sessions. But if we want persistent sessions or audit, a user_sessions table can track active refresh tokens and their metadata (last used, etc.). Alternatively, we fully rely on Redis for active sessions (more in Security section).

Constraints & Indexes: We ensure important constraints at the DB level:
	•	Uniqueness of payment_intent_id in orders (so one Stripe PaymentIntent ties to one order).
	•	Possibly a constraint that each seat can only be in one order_line per event. But since we have event_seats, we already enforce one order_id per seat at DB level by updating that field.
	•	Foreign key constraints for data integrity (order_lines -> orders, etc., with cascading deletes if appropriate).
	•	We avoid complex updatable views or triggers for simplicity and to keep logic in application code (the outbox pattern is a notable exception where a trigger could be used, but we’ll implement it in app logic for clarity).

MongoDB Schema (Seat Maps & Layouts)

MongoDB holds the VenueLayout and seat map documents because they are fairly static, occasionally large (a JSON with thousands of seat coordinates), and don’t require complex relational queries. Using Mongo gives flexibility in schema for different venue configurations and easy immutability by versioning documents.

A venue_layout document might look like:

{
  "_id": "layout_venue123_v1",       // includes version in ID or have a separate field
  "venue_id": "venue_123",
  "layout_name": "Venue 123 Standard Layout",
  "version": 1,
  "status": "published",            // draft, published, deployed
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "Section A",
      "rows": [
        {
          "name": "A",
          "seats": [
            {"number": 1, "seat_id": "S1", "x": 34, "y": 120},
            {"number": 2, "seat_id": "S2", "x": 54, "y": 120},
            // ... more seats
          ]
        }
        // ... more rows
      ]
    }
    // ... more sections
  ],
  "created_at": ISODate("2025-01-10T12:00:00Z"),
  "published_at": ISODate("2025-01-15T09:00:00Z")
}

	•	The seat_id inside might correspond to a physical seat (could be a composite like venue-section-row-num or a GUID). These IDs will map to seats in the event_seats table for specific shows.
	•	We maintain immutability: when a layout is “published”, we either prevent further edits or create a new version document for changes. Draft versions can be updated in place (in Mongo) by admins. Once finalized (published), that JSON is treated as read-only. If the venue changes (like adding seats), a new version document is created (the old one stays for audit).
	•	When an event is created, we might snapshot the layout ID it uses (e.g., event references layout_id and version). If we want to allow minor layout tweaks per event, we could copy the JSON for that event, but that’s heavy and usually not needed – most events reuse a standard layout.
	•	The seat map JSON can be cached in CDN. For instance, once published, we push it to an S3 or similar and use CloudFront. The API GET /shows/:id/layout can just redirect or provide the URL to the CDN-hosted JSON (or even an image overlay).
	•	If needed, smaller dynamic data (like which seats are sold or unavailable) could be overlaid from the relational data, but we do not update the Mongo document for availability; that lives in Postgres/Redis.

Redis Keyspace Design

Redis is used for ephemeral locks, cache, and session tokens. We follow a naming convention for keys to avoid collisions and allow maintenance (like key scans by prefix):
	•	Seat Locks: ticket:lock:seat:{eventId}:{seatId} -> value: "{version}:{sessionId}".
When a seat is held, we SET NX this key with a value containing the seat’s current version and the holding session/user ID, with an expiration (TTL) equal to the hold timeout (e.g., 2 minutes). The prefix ticket:lock:seat: helps identify all seat locks. We include eventId since seat IDs might repeat across events.
	•	Batch Locks: If multiple seats are locked in one request, we will create multiple keys (one per seat). A successful batch hold ensures either all keys are set or none (via a Lua script or multi-step pipeline, see Section 4).
	•	Idempotency Keys: ticket:idem:{key}. We store a short-lived record of processed idempotent requests. For example, if a client posts to /orders with Idempotency-Key “ABC123”, we could store ticket:idem:orders:ABC123 -> { orderId: ... } with a TTL (perhaps 1 day or a few hours). On a retry with the same key, we either return the stored result or ignore the duplicate. These could also be stored in Postgres for permanence, but Redis is faster and sufficient if we assume clients won’t retry after a long time (we tune the TTL to cover typical retry windows).
	•	Session Tokens: We use JWTs for access (15 min lifespan) and opaque tokens for refresh.
	•	Access tokens (JWT) are short-lived and not stored server-side (just validated via signature).
	•	Refresh tokens: auth:rt:{userId}:{tokenId} -> some marker (e.g., “valid” or session data). We store refresh tokens in Redis so they can be quickly invalidated or rotated. The tokenId (JWT ID or a random ID) is embedded in the refresh token; when a refresh token is used, we rotate: generate a new token and new Redis key, and set the old one’s value to “used” (or just delete it). If an old refresh token is used again, it won’t be found or marked used, signaling a possible reuse attack – the request is denied.
	•	Optionally, store active access tokens: auth:sess:{sessionId} mapping to user info and expiration, mainly if we want an easy global logout or to store metadata. But since access is JWT, we usually don’t store it, we trust expiration.
	•	Cache keys: We may cache frequently read data with short TTL to reduce DB load:
	•	ticket:cache:shows:{showId}:layout -> store the seat map JSON or portions of it (though that’s also on CDN).
	•	ticket:cache:shows:{showId}:availability -> a snapshot of current availability (e.g., updated every few seconds). However, real-time availability is tricky to cache due to rapid changes; we might skip caching availability, or cache only for very small TTL (a few seconds) if needed. Alternatively, we might cache only less volatile info like total seats sold count, etc.
	•	ticket:cache:venues:{venueId} -> venue info, etc.
	•	Locking tokens: In addition to seat locks, other locks could be used:
	•	Order placement lock per user: e.g., ticket:lock:user:{userId}:order if we want to prevent a user from accidentally creating two orders at once in two tabs (not usually necessary unless malicious).
	•	Rate limit counters: e.g., ticket:rl:IP:{ip} if implementing simple rate limiting or proof-of-work tracking.

We ensure Redis keys have reasonable TTLs to avoid orphaned data. For locks, TTL is the hold duration (plus a small buffer). For idempotency, TTL could be on the order of hours (client retries) up to a day. Session keys TTL corresponds to token expiry (e.g., refresh token maybe 30 days, but with rotation on use).

4. Locking & Consistency

To handle 200k simultaneous buyers contending for limited seats, we implement a dual-layer locking strategy combining Redis and Postgres. This provides the speed of in-memory locks and the safety of DB transactional checks (a pattern sometimes called fenced locks or optimistic locks with fencing).

Fenced Locking Pattern

Goal: Prevent two processes from ever successfully reserving the same seat. The approach:
	1.	Monotonic Version in Postgres: Each seat (each (event_id, seat_id) row) has a version number that increments on each state change (or each lock acquisition attempt).
	2.	Redis Lock with Token: When a user tries to hold a seat, the application first reads the current version from Postgres for that seat. Suppose seat 42 (event A) has version 5 currently.
	3.	The application generates a lock token like "6:<sessionId>" (next version = 5+1, paired with the user’s session ID or some unique lock ID). It then attempts SET ticket:lock:seat:A:42 "6:session123" NX PX <ttl> in Redis.
	•	If the result is OK (lock acquired), no other user holds that seat currently.
	•	If the key already exists, someone else has it held; we abort (return seat not available).
	4.	Equality Check in DB Transaction: Immediately after acquiring the Redis lock, we perform a guarded update in Postgres to increment the version and (if we choose) mark the seat reserved:
	•	UPDATE event_seats SET version = 6 WHERE event_id=A AND seat_id=42 AND version = 5;
	•	If this update affects 0 rows, it means the version in DB was not 5 (someone else might have updated it in between). In practice, with the Redis NX lock, this should not happen during normal operation (it would imply someone bypassed the Redis lock or a race condition with lock expiry). If it does happen, we treat it as a failed lock (and release the Redis key just in case).
	•	If update succeeds (1 row), we have fenced this operation with version=6. This means any subsequent operation for this seat must have a higher version, so even if our Redis lock expires, another process that acquires a new lock will have version >= 7, and will not mistakenly commit over our changes without noticing version differences.
	5.	Now the seat is considered “OnHold” by this session. We do not mark it as reserved in DB yet (that happens when the order is created). We rely on the Redis lock to indicate its temporary unavailability.
	6.	When the user confirms the purchase (order creation), we again check the Postgres version in the transaction:
	•	We attempt to reserve the seat: UPDATE event_seats SET status='RESERVED', order_id = <orderId> WHERE event_id=A AND seat_id=42 AND version = 6; (using the version we locked with).
	•	If the seat is still on version 6, this update succeeds and also implicitly bumps version to 7 (either via a trigger or we include , version = version + 1 in the update).
	•	If this update fails (0 rows), it means our hold expired or was lost (the version changed to 7 by some other process, perhaps a timeout release). In that case, we abort the order creation with a 409 Conflict – Stale Lock error.
	7.	After successful reservation, we delete the Redis lock (DEL ticket:lock:seat:A:42) because the seat is now reserved in DB (no one else can take it anyway). If the client abandons after holding (no order created), the lock will expire after TTL and the seat remains available in DB (since we never changed status). A background job will notice expired holds and possibly increment the version to invalidate stale locks (explained below).

Batch Acquisition: When a user selects multiple seats at once, we must lock all or none (to avoid partial holds where a user holds some seats but not others they wanted). We achieve this with a Lua script or multi-step pipeline in Redis:
	•	Attempt to lock each seat key with the next version token:
	•	Use EVAL with a Lua script that loops through a list of seat keys:
	•	If any seat key is already taken, the script returns failure (and leaves all untouched).
	•	If none are taken, the script sets all keys with their respective token and TTL.
	•	This operation is atomic. Either the user gets all requested seats or none.
	•	If it fails (at least one seat unavailable), we return an error for the whole request (and possibly inform which seats were unavailable).
	•	If it succeeds, we proceed to the Postgres step for each seat version as above. We can do the version bump updates for all seats within one transaction (or separate, but one transaction is better if we are updating seat versions in DB). If any update fails (which is unlikely if the locks were acquired), we rollback and release any locks we did set.
	•	We also consider deadlocks in DB if updating multiple seats: to avoid that, ensure we always lock seats in a consistent order (e.g., sort by seat_id or some deterministic ordering when acquiring in DB). The Redis script acquired all or none, so no partial scenario there, but the DB updates should also follow a sorted order with FOR UPDATE perhaps to avoid traditional RDBMS deadlocks.

TTL and Lock Expiration: We set a ceiling on hold time (say 2 minutes by default). Users must complete checkout quickly. We allow possibly one extension (via /seats/extend) for maybe an additional minute or two, but enforce an absolute maximum (e.g., 5 minutes max hold) to prevent users holding seats indefinitely (especially bots). The Redis key’s TTL will be extended if the user calls an extend endpoint and is authorized (and still before expiration). Extension is done with a careful check: only the holder’s session should be allowed to extend its own lock (we could store sessionId in the lock value and verify).
	•	If a hold TTL expires, Redis will delete the key automatically. The seat will appear available again. However, our Postgres version is now out-of-sync by one (it was incremented when the hold was placed). To prevent a stale client from using an expired lock, we rely on the version check as described. Additionally, we run a compensator job: a periodic process (say every minute) that scans for any seats in DB that are marked available but whose version suggests there was a hold:
	•	We can scan Redis for keys ticket:lock:seat:* to gather currently locked seats. But scanning all keys at scale is heavy; instead:
	•	Keep track of holds placed in memory or a Redis set temporarily. Or maintain a small table of active holds in Postgres for monitoring (though that reintroduces writes).
	•	Simpler: when a hold expires, the next person to try that seat will just attempt a lock with version 7 while DB is at 6; our equality check will catch that and maybe we decide to allow if no one else has reserved in between. Actually, if Redis key is gone, DB still at version6, a new hold attempt will use version7 and succeed in both Redis and the DB update (because DB version=6 matches expectation in update). So it self-resolves by bumping to 7 on the next lock attempt. The only edge case is if no one tries the seat again, the DB version stays incremented beyond what it was initially – which is fine.
	•	However, what if an order creation comes just after the lock expired? The user’s Redis lock expired at 2:00, but at 2:01 their client still tries to POST /orders. They present a version 6 token but the Redis key is gone. In our order creation logic, we do UPDATE ... WHERE version = 6. That will succeed if the seat is still available and version still 6. Uh oh, that means an expired hold could still result in a reservation if it happens after expiration but before another user locks it. To prevent that, we can do one of two things:
	•	Shorten effective UI time by slightly less than TTL (tell client they have 1:50 if TTL is 2:00, to account for grace).
	•	Use the compensator to proactively bump version when TTL expires. E.g., a background job could periodically check for keys about to expire or just expired:
	•	If ticket:lock:seat:A:42 is not found but DB thinks version=6 and status available, and if we know 6 corresponds to an active hold that just expired, we increment DB version to 7 to invalidate the old token. But knowing which version to bump requires tracking holds.
	•	We could embed expiration timestamp in the Redis lock value or maintain a small Redis sorted set of expiry times. However, this complexity might not be needed if the window of race is small.
	•	Alternatively, incorporate the expiration time into the equality check: for example, include in the Order creation request the expected expiration or a token. This is probably overkill. Simpler: the user’s attempt after expiration will likely fail the Redis lock step (because they’d try to re-lock or something).
	•	We will document that if a user tries to confirm after their hold expired, they will likely get an error (stale lock). To enforce it, we can check Redis lock right before finalizing order. If not present (expired), we reject even if DB version matches. This double-check (Redis presence + DB version) ensures no sneak-through.

Exactly-Once Webhook Processing: For payments (and any asynchronous events) we use an outbox pattern:
	•	When Stripe sends a webhook (say payment_intent.succeeded for a PaymentIntent ID), our API endpoint /payments/webhooks does minimal work synchronously: it verifies the Stripe signature (security), then writes a record to stripe_events table and commits. The insert uses the Stripe event_id and has a unique constraint, ensuring if Stripe retries the same event, we won’t duplicate (the second insert will violate unique and we can safely ignore or return 200 OK since it’s already processed).
	•	A separate Outbox Worker process (or thread) polls the stripe_events table for new, unprocessed events. We use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED to grab a batch of events atomically and mark them as processing. For each event, we start a DB transaction and perform the associated domain action:
	•	E.g., for a payment success: find the corresponding Order (by payment_intent_id), check it’s still pending, update its status to ‘CONFIRMED’, set updated_at, maybe store a payment confirmation timestamp, insert an order_audit_log entry, and mark the stripe_events.processed=true. All of this happens in one transaction – ensuring that we only mark the event processed if the order update succeeded. Then commit.
	•	If the transaction fails (e.g., DB error or concurrency issue), it will roll back and we do not set processed, so the event remains to be retried.
	•	The worker, upon success, will send any post-processing notifications (like send confirmation email, or push notification via a separate mechanism). Those side effects can be done after commit or by another outbox for communications, to keep the payment confirmation atomic.
	•	We implement retries with backoff: if a Stripe event processing fails due to a recoverable issue (e.g., a deadlock or temporary DB issue), the worker can catch the exception and retry after a short delay. Alternatively, just leave it unprocessed for the next iteration. We use an exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s…) and a max retry count to avoid infinite loops on a poisoned message.
	•	Poison message handling: If an event consistently fails (say, an unexpected event type or a logic bug), we don’t want to block the whole queue. The worker can mark it as “error” or move it to a separate table stripe_events_dead after X attempts, and mark it processed in the main table just to skip it. This ensures the rest continue. We’ll also alert/devops when this happens to fix the underlying issue.
	•	Idempotency in processing: Even without the unique constraint, our order update logic is idempotent: if a payment event is applied twice, the second time we’d find the order already confirmed and would do nothing or just skip. But the unique constraint and processed flag prevent that code path from executing twice.
	•	We keep the window of possible double-processing minimal. Stripe’s own retries and idempotency keys help on their side; on our side, the combination of DB constraints and outbox ensures once we mark success, duplicates are ignored.

Overall, locking and consistency measures combine to ensure no double bookings, no double charges, and consistency even under heavy load or failure scenarios. The use of Redis dramatically reduces DB hot contention on popular seats, while Postgres ensures the final correctness (the second layer “vault door” that guarantees no invariant is broken).

5. API Design (OpenAPI)

We expose a RESTful API for all operations, designed for use by our mobile apps, web frontend, and potentially third-party integrations. All endpoints are authenticated unless noted (e.g., public event listing might be open or have a separate public API). We use JSON for request/response and follow HTTP best practices (appropriate status codes, idempotency where needed, etc.). Key API endpoints include:
	•	Auth: Handles login (if not using an external IdP) and token refresh.
	•	POST /auth/login – (If applicable) User login, returns JWT and refresh token (could also be handled via OAuth if not rolling our own).
	•	POST /auth/refresh – Use refresh token (in cookie or request) to get a new JWT access token. Implements refresh token rotation: on success, issues a new refresh token (and old one is invalidated in Redis).
	•	POST /auth/logout – Invalidate the current refresh token (logs the user out, requiring re-login). For JWT, client simply discards it, but we also remove the server-side refresh entry and possibly blacklist the JWT (though short TTL makes blacklist optional).
	•	Note: On web, refresh could be done via a secure HTTP-only cookie; on mobile, tokens are stored in secure storage.
	•	Catalog (Events & Layouts):
	•	GET /venues/{id} – Get venue details (name, address, etc., maybe seat layout IDs).
	•	GET /shows/{id} – Get details of an event/show (name, date, venue, status).
	•	GET /shows/{id}/layout – Get the seat map for the show’s venue layout. This might return a presigned URL or redirect to CDN where the seat map JSON/image is hosted. Alternatively, it returns the seat map JSON directly if small enough. This is often a public/unauth endpoint (or minimally scoped auth) so that the seat map can be fetched quickly by clients (possibly even before login if browsing events).
	•	GET /shows/{id}/availability – (Optional, if we provide an API to fetch current availability map) Returns which seats are available/reserved. We might exclude seats that are merely OnHold unless we want to show them as temporarily unavailable (perhaps mark them differently). This could be a frequently polled endpoint during on-sale. To reduce load, we might not expose it and instead handle availability at seat selection time.
	•	Seating (Seat Selection & Holds):
	•	POST /seats/hold – Hold one or multiple seats for a short period.
	•	Request: list of seat IDs (and event/show ID), perhaps { "seats": [ { "event_id": X, "seat_id": Y }, ... ] }. Or if we restrict hold to one event at a time, event_id can be a path or field and a list of seat_ids.
	•	Optionally a hold_duration if extension allowed (but likely fixed by server).
	•	Response: success indicates seats are held for the session. We return the expiration time or TTL so the client knows how long the hold lasts, and perhaps a hold token (though the token is essentially the session credentials + seat IDs, so not needed separately).
	•	Errors: 409 Conflict if any seat is already taken (with an error code like SEAT_UNAVAILABLE listing which seat failed), 422 Unprocessable Entity if invalid input (seat doesn’t exist, etc.), 401 if not authenticated or authorized.
	•	Idempotency: Clients should include an Idempotency-Key header if they retry this to avoid duplicate holds (though holding twice usually just fails second time if first succeeded because seat is no longer available).
	•	POST /seats/hold/batch – If we separate single vs batch holds. We might use the same /seats/hold for both single and batch by accepting multiple seat IDs. The separate endpoint isn’t strictly needed if the request format covers multiple.
	•	POST /seats/extend – Extend the hold duration for currently held seats.
	•	Request: perhaps the same seat list or a hold identifier (but since our holds are implicit by user session and seat IDs, the server can look them up by session).
	•	Only allowed once (the server can enforce or return error if max extension exceeded).
	•	Response: new expiration time.
	•	Errors: 408 Request Timeout or 410 Gone if the hold already expired and thus cannot be extended, 403 Forbidden if user tries to extend a hold they don’t own.
	•	POST /seats/release – Release seats that were on hold (if user decides to abandon selection).
	•	Request: seat IDs (and event id).
	•	Effect: deletes the Redis locks immediately so others can grab the seats. Also could roll back the Postgres version or status if we had marked something (in our design we didn’t mark status as locked, just left as available, so no DB change needed other than maybe version if we incremented it; but we won’t decrement version, we might leave it or increment again to signify a state change that effectively does nothing except bump version).
	•	Usually no need to call this if the user simply lets it expire, but it’s polite to free sooner.
	•	Can be called automatically if the user navigates away from checkout.
	•	No harm if called after expiration (it would just be a no-op since the key is gone).
	•	Orders:
	•	POST /orders – Create an order for the currently held seats and initiate payment.
	•	Request: could include the list of seat IDs being purchased (again) and payment details. However, since seats are already held by the user’s session (and we have that context via a token or session), we might infer the seats from the hold (to avoid race of specifying seats not actually on hold).
	•	If using Stripe PaymentIntents:
	•	Option 1: Client provides a payment_method_id or something (if using Stripe’s client-side collection).
	•	Option 2: Server creates a PaymentIntent. E.g., the request might contain just the seats and maybe a payment method type, and server will call Stripe to create a PaymentIntent of the appropriate amount.
	•	Server actions: Validate the user still holds those seats (check Redis & DB version as described), calculate total price, create Order and OrderLines in DB, set Order status to PendingPayment, attach a PaymentIntent (Stripe).
	•	If creating PaymentIntent server-side: call Stripe API (via StripePort) with amount, currency, etc., get back an id and client_secret.
	•	Save payment_intent_id in Order, and possibly payment_status = 'INITIATED'.
	•	Response: Order details including an order_id and perhaps the client_secret for the PaymentIntent. The client will use that client_secret with Stripe’s SDK to present a card UI or confirmation. If the payment is already confirmed instantly (like if using a saved card with no further auth), the webhook may even confirm the order very fast.
	•	Idempotency: Very important here. If the client sends two createOrder requests (due to timeout or clicking twice), we use Idempotency-Key to ensure only one Order is created. The second request will return the first order’s info (or an error if the first is still processing). On the server, we might also ensure that a given set of held seats can only produce one order – once an order is created, further attempts to use those holds should fail or be tied to the same order.
	•	Errors:
	•	409 Conflict (STALE_LOCK) if the seats are not actually locked by the user or if the hold expired – indicating the client is using stale data.
	•	422 Unprocessable Entity if payment creation failed or other business rule (like seats count mismatch).
	•	402 Payment Required might be used if for some reason we want to indicate payment failure at this stage (though usually payment isn’t collected until client uses Stripe UI).
	•	GET /orders/{id} – Retrieve order details (and status).
	•	Allows client to poll order status if they didn’t implement push notifications for confirmation. E.g., while waiting for payment confirmation, they might poll this.
	•	Includes order status, seats, total, and if confirmed, perhaps the digital tickets or QR codes. If pending, maybe an ETA or just status.
	•	This requires auth and the order must belong to the user (authorization check).
	•	POST /orders/{id}/cancel – Cancel an order.
	•	Two scenarios:
	1.	User cancels before payment is completed (essentially freeing seats). This will release the seat reservations: update order status to CANCELED, update seats back to Available (if they were marked reserved), and notify payment (if a PaymentIntent was created, we might cancel it via Stripe API to avoid a late payment going through).
	2.	Admin or user refund after payment (if allowed): If an order was confirmed and tickets issued, cancellation might trigger a refund (could integrate with Stripe to refund the charge). In that case, we’d set status to REFUNDED and possibly mark seats as available for resale if event policy allows resale or put them in a resale marketplace.
	•	We will implement at least the pre-payment cancellation. Post-payment cancellations/refunds might be an administrative endpoint or part of a separate flow.
	•	Idempotency: Cancel can also be idempotent (canceling twice is fine – second time would just see it’s already canceled).
	•	Errors: 400 Bad Request if cancel not allowed (e.g., trying to cancel after event is over), 404 if order not found or not yours, 409 if an illegal transition (e.g., order already confirmed – then use refund not cancel).
	•	Payments:
	•	POST /payments/webhooks – Endpoint for Stripe (and any PSP) to call with payment events.
	•	It expects the raw request body and a signature header (Stripe provides) for verification. Our API will verify the signature (using Stripe’s signing secret) to ensure authenticity.
	•	On success, returns 200 quickly (within Stripe’s timeout, ~500ms) after queuing the event in the database.
	•	This endpoint might handle various event types: payment_intent.succeeded, .payment_failed, .refund.succeeded, etc., by inserting into stripe_events with appropriate type.
	•	We don’t include sensitive info in the URL; the secret is enough. Also, it might be under a path that’s not publicized except to Stripe.
	•	No auth (Stripe cannot provide our token), instead we secure by verifying the signature.
	•	We respond with proper codes: 2xx for accepted, 4xx if bad signature (Stripe will not retry those) or 5xx if something internal failed (Stripe will retry later).

Error Handling & Status Codes:
We use specific HTTP codes to indicate errors, and include a structured response with an error code and message:
	•	409 Conflict: When a request cannot be completed due to a concurrent update or state conflict. For example, attempting to hold a seat that just got taken, or trying to finalize an order with an expired hold. We might return a JSON like {"error": "STALE_LOCK", "message": "Seat no longer available"}.
	•	422 Unprocessable Entity: For business rule violations or invalid state transitions. E.g., trying to reserve seats without holding them, or payment info invalid. Also validation errors on inputs (though 400 is also used for generic invalid input, 422 for semantic issues).
	•	429 Too Many Requests: If our anti-bot or rate limiter triggers, e.g., too many hold attempts or login attempts. We will include a Retry-After header when appropriate.
	•	401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden: If missing auth or not allowed (e.g., trying to access another user’s order).
	•	500 Internal Server Error: We strive to avoid, but any unhandled exceptions result in 500. We will log these and not expose details to the client.

Idempotency: We expect clients to send an Idempotency-Key header (as per Stripe’s style) for POST requests like creating orders or holds. Our API will look for this header and use it to ensure duplicate requests are not processed twice. For instance, if a client times out waiting for POST /orders response but our server actually created the order, the client can retry with the same key. The server will detect the same key and return the existing order info rather than creating a new one. We’ll document this behavior in the API docs. Idempotency keys could be stored in Redis as mentioned, mapping to a saved response or result.

Pagination & Filtering: For any list endpoints (e.g., if we had GET /events or a user’s orders list), we will implement pagination. Typically, we’ll use cursor-based pagination for better performance at scale (e.g., page through by created_at or an opaque page token) or limit/offset if data set is small. For example, GET /orders?limit=50&cursor=<token> to get pages of a user’s past orders. We also allow filtering by event, date, etc., for admin endpoints (like an org admin listing all orders for their event).

6. Application Layer (Use Cases & Ports)

The application layer coordinates the domain logic for each use case while remaining decoupled from technical details via ports (interfaces). Each bounded context has a set of use case services (interactors) implementing operations, and ports that abstract infrastructure or cross-context interactions.

Core Use Cases

We identify the main use cases corresponding to the flows:
	•	HoldSeats (and HoldSeatsBatch): Called when a user selects seats to put on hold. It accepts event ID and seat IDs. It interacts with the Seating context to acquire locks. It might return a Hold domain object or just a success with expiration time. Internally, it will:
	1.	Validate the seats are available (e.g., check via SeatLockRepo or by querying event_seats status + checking Redis locks).
	2.	Call SeatLockRepository.acquireSeats(eventId, seatIds, sessionId, ttl) which implements the Redis locking and version bump logic.
	3.	If successful, perhaps record something in an in-memory structure for this session (so the session knows what it holds, useful for extending or releasing).
	4.	Return result (success or failure).
	•	ReleaseSeats: Frees previously held seats (if user cancels selection). It calls SeatLockRepository.releaseSeats(eventId, seatIds, sessionId) which will delete the Redis keys (only if owned by that session, to avoid releasing someone else’s hold).
	•	It may also update Postgres if necessary (in our design, maybe not needed unless we had changed state; primarily just cleans up).
	•	ExtendHold: Extends a hold’s TTL. It likely calls a method on SeatLockRepo that does PEXPIRE or similar on the Redis key to add time, and possibly ensures not beyond max. It will check that the session calling is the owner (via the token stored in the lock value).
	•	CreateOrder: This is invoked when user commits to purchase:
	1.	Calls Seating.verifyLocks(eventId, seatIds, sessionId) – ensures the user indeed holds those seats and locks are valid (could be part of SeatLockRepo or OrderService logic).
	2.	Calculates pricing (e.g., sum seat prices, maybe apply fees).
	3.	Uses an atomic DB transaction (via a UnitOfWork or Transaction port) to: insert an Order, insert OrderLines for each seat, update seat status to RESERVED and link order (for each seat, ensure the version matches the lock version to avoid stale locks as discussed).
	4.	Calls StripePort.createPaymentIntent(orderId, amount) to create a PaymentIntent via Stripe API (if doing server-side PI creation). This call is external – we want to avoid doing it inside the DB transaction since it’s network I/O. So we have two approaches:
	•	Pre-create the PaymentIntent before committing the order. But then if DB commit fails, we have a PaymentIntent hanging (could be canceled or reused).
	•	Or create PaymentIntent after DB commit. But if PaymentIntent creation fails, we have an order pending without a payment. We could then allow retry or cancellation.
	•	A pragmatic approach: create PaymentIntent after inserting the order (still in transaction, but that breaks the rule of external call in txn). Alternatively, reserve the order in DB, commit, then call Stripe. If Stripe fails, mark order as canceled or have a status ‘PAYMENT_FAILED’. This complicates flow but could happen.
	•	We will likely do: DB transaction for order creation without calling Stripe inside. After commit, call Stripe. If it fails, update order status to canceled (or keep it pending and allow retry).
	5.	Return the order details and PaymentIntent info to client.
	•	ConfirmPayment: This use case is triggered not by direct client call but by the webhook/outbox process. When a payment success event is received:
	1.	It loads the relevant Order by PaymentIntent ID (via OrderRepo).
	2.	Checks that it’s in PendingPayment and matches the expected amount, etc.
	3.	Transitions Order status to Confirmed, sets payment timestamp, etc.
	4.	Updates each OrderLine status to confirmed and updates seats status to Paid/Sold in event_seats.
	5.	Writes an audit log entry.
	6.	Calls downstream actions: e.g., enqueue sending of tickets or push notification.
	•	CancelOrder: Use case for user or admin cancel. If before payment:
	1.	Validate state is PendingPayment (or Draft).
	2.	Update order status to CANCELED, free up seats (update event_seats status to AVAILABLE, increment version to invalidate locks).
	3.	If a PaymentIntent exists, call StripePort.cancelPaymentIntent to cancel it (so it can’t later succeed).
	4.	Write audit log.
If after payment (refund scenario):
	5.	Ensure state is Confirmed.
	6.	Call StripePort.issueRefund (and perhaps mark order as REFUND_PENDING then actual REFUNDED when webhook confirms refund).
	7.	Mark order REFUNDED, free seats (depending on business decision: usually once paid, if refunded, we might put those tickets back as available for resale if time permits).
	8.	Audit log and notification.
	•	GetOrder: Fetch order details (with lines and seat info) for display to user or admin. This use case might involve aggregating data from OrderRepo and maybe layout info for seat names. It should ensure auth (user can only get their own order, or admin with proper role can get any in their domain).

These use case methods correspond closely to API endpoints. The Application layer orchestrates calls to domain and infrastructure through ports:

Ports (Interfaces) and Adapters

To keep the core logic testable and independent of specific technologies, we define interfaces for all external interactions:
	•	SeatLockRepository (Port): Abstracts operations on seat locks and possibly seat state. Example methods:
	•	acquireSeats(eventId, seatIds[], sessionId, ttl) -> boolean (or returns details like which failed).
	•	releaseSeats(eventId, seatIds[], sessionId).
	•	extendHold(eventId, seatIds[], sessionId, extraTime).
	•	verifyLock(eventId, seatId, sessionId) -> boolean (checks if the given session indeed holds the seat).
Implementation: in RedisSeatLockRepository – uses Redis commands and possibly Postgres updates for versions. It may also use OrderRepo or SeatRepo to validate seat availability. This repo spans the Seating context (because it touches seat version in Postgres and lock in Redis).
	•	SeatRepository / SeatingRepository: Interface to query and update seat inventory in Postgres.
	•	findAvailableSeats(eventId) for availability listing (if needed).
	•	reserveSeats(orderId, list of seatIds, expectedVersionMap) – to update seats to reserved inside a transaction, with version checks.
	•	markSeatsSold(orderId) – to update seats to sold.
	•	releaseSeatsTx(orderId) – to free seats (set available) if order canceled.
	•	Alternatively, these could be methods on OrderRepository as part of order creation.
	•	OrderRepository: Interface for CRUD on orders.
	•	createOrder(order) – inserts order and lines (maybe within a provided transaction context).
	•	findById(orderId) – get order with lines.
	•	findByPaymentIntent(pi_id) – to get order for a webhook.
	•	updateStatus(orderId, newStatus) – for updating state in transactions.
	•	This will be implemented by PostgresOrderRepository using SQL/ORM.
	•	LayoutRepository (or LayoutQueryService): Interface to fetch layout data (from Mongo).
	•	getLayout(layoutId) or getLayoutByEvent(eventId) – returns the seat map (perhaps used to enrich responses or by admin tools).
	•	Implementation: MongoLayoutRepository – uses MongoDB driver to fetch the JSON. Possibly caches it.
	•	StripePort (PaymentsPort): Interface abstracting calls to Stripe (or another PSP).
	•	createPaymentIntent(orderId, amount, currency) -> PaymentIntentRef – calls Stripe API to create an intent (with idempotency key perhaps equal to orderId to avoid duplicates).
	•	cancelPaymentIntent(paymentIntentId) – if order canceled.
	•	retrieveEvent(eventId) – possibly to verify webhook data if needed.
	•	refundPayment(paymentIntentId, amount) – for refunds.
	•	Implementation: StripeApiClient – uses Stripe’s SDK or REST API. This is behind an interface so we can plug a dummy for tests or swap with another provider.
	•	NotificationPort: (Not explicitly mentioned, but could be inferred for sending notifications/emails)
	•	e.g., sendOrderConfirmation(userId, orderId) to email tickets or push notifications. For push, mobile clients will likely connect via Firebase/APNS with tokens; we could integrate that here or via an external service.
	•	Transaction (UnitOfWork) Interface: To ensure multiple repository actions occur in one DB transaction consistently.
	•	In a monolithic deployment, we can use a single Postgres transaction for all DB actions. We might define a TransactionManager port that can run a function in a transaction. For example:

interface TransactionManager {
    <T> T executeInTransaction(Supplier<T> operations);
}

	•	This will start a DB transaction (possibly also involve a distributed transaction if needed across DBs, but we try to avoid multi-DB transactions).
	•	The OrderService would use this to wrap creating order + reserving seats.
	•	The outbox worker uses it to update order and stripe_events atomically.

	•	Implementation: could be a simple wrapper around JDBC or an ORM’s transaction. Since we mostly use Postgres for all transactional data, a single connection transaction suffices. If we needed to include Mongo in a transaction (we don’t, since layout data changes are separate and non-critical), we’d do two-phase commit or simpler: we avoid cross-DB transaction – e.g., first write Postgres then separately update Mongo eventual (not needed here because layout changes are not in the same workflow as orders).

	•	Clock and IdGenerator: Utility ports for determinism in tests.
	•	Clock to fetch current time (so we can simulate time in tests, e.g., for TTL expiration).
	•	IdGen to generate new IDs for orders, etc. We might use UUID v4 or v7 or ULID; an interface lets us plug a stub in tests or a specific generator.

Infrastructure Adapters:
For each port, we have a concrete implementation:
	•	PostgresSeatRepository: uses SQL/ORM to update and query the event_seats table.
	•	RedisSeatLockRepository: uses a Redis client. For complex Lua logic (batch lock), this adapter may load a Lua script into Redis and call it.
	•	PostgresOrderRepository: for orders and lines.
	•	MongoLayoutRepository: uses MongoDB driver to get layouts.
	•	StripeApiClient: uses Stripe’s SDK (e.g., the official Stripe library for Node/Java/Python or direct HTTPS requests). It will incorporate Stripe keys from config and set idempotency keys on calls.
	•	NotificationService: (if needed) maybe using AWS SNS or Firebase for push, SES for email, etc.

Use Case Execution Flow: When an API call comes in (say POST /orders), the controller or handler in the Interface layer will:
	1.	Authenticate the user (ensure token is valid, user is authorized for the event/tenant).
	2.	Validate the request payload.
	3.	Call the appropriate Application Service method, e.g., orderService.createOrder(userId, eventId, seatIds, paymentMethodInfo).
	4.	The orderService.createOrder (in Ordering context) will orchestrate:
	•	calls holdService.verifyHold(userId, seats) from Seating context to ensure the seats are held by this user.
	•	starts a transaction (via TransactionManager).
	•	within the transaction, calls orderRepository.insert(order) and seatRepository.reserveSeats(orderId, seats) (the latter updates seat status and bumps versions).
	•	commit transaction.
	•	calls paymentService.initiatePayment(order) which calls StripePort to create the PaymentIntent.
	•	maybe update order with PaymentIntent ID (if not done in the transaction).
	5.	Return DTO/response to controller, which formats JSON for output.

This approach ensures separation of concerns: e.g., the Seating context might expose a SeatLockService that encapsulates both Redis lock and the Postgres version handling behind one method, so that the Ordering service doesn’t deal with Redis directly.

For clarity, here’s a snippet of what a port interface might look like and usage (pseudo-code):

// Port Interfaces
interface SeatLockRepository {
    boolean acquireSeats(UUID eventId, List<UUID> seatIds, UUID sessionId, Duration ttl);
    void releaseSeats(UUID eventId, List<UUID> seatIds, UUID sessionId);
    void extendSeats(UUID eventId, List<UUID> seatIds, UUID sessionId, Duration extra);
    boolean verifySeatHeld(UUID eventId, UUID seatId, UUID sessionId);
}

interface OrderRepository {
    Order save(Order order);  // saves order and lines
    Order findById(UUID orderId);
    Order findByPaymentIntent(String paymentIntentId);
    void updateStatus(UUID orderId, OrderStatus status);
}

// Use Case example
class OrderService {
    private final SeatLockRepository seatLockRepo;
    private final OrderRepository orderRepo;
    private final TransactionManager tx;
    private final StripePort payments;
    
    Order createOrder(UUID userId, UUID eventId, List<UUID> seatIds, PaymentMethod method) {
        // Ensure user holds the seats
        for (UUID seatId : seatIds) {
            if (!seatLockRepo.verifySeatHeld(eventId, seatId, userSessionId)) {
                throw new StaleLockException("Seat not held: " + seatId);
            }
        }
        Order order = tx.executeInTransaction(() -> {
            // Build order and lines
            Order o = new Order(userId, eventId, amountCalc(seatIds));
            o.setStatus(PENDING_PAYMENT);
            o.setLines(seatIds.map(id -> new OrderLine(id, priceFor(id))));
            // Save order and lines
            orderRepo.save(o);
            // Reserve seats in DB
            seatRepository.reserveSeats(eventId, seatIds, o.getId());
            return o;
        });
        // Outside transaction: initiate payment
        PaymentIntentRef piRef = payments.createPaymentIntent(order.getId(), order.getAmount(), order.getCurrency());
        // Attach PaymentIntent to order (persist it)
        orderRepo.updatePaymentReference(order.getId(), piRef.getId());
        return order.withPaymentIntent(piRef);
    }
}

(Above code is illustrative; actual implementation and error handling omitted for brevity.)

The key point is each adapter (Postgres, Redis, etc.) can be swapped (for testing, we can have an in-memory stub of SeatLockRepository that simulates locking).

Finally, the CDN publisher (part of Catalog context) would be another service or adapter: when an admin publishes a layout or when seats are being sold, it might push static content to CDN or purge cache. For example, a LayoutService might have a method publishLayout(layoutId) that fetches the layout JSON from Mongo and uploads it to S3 and/or purges CloudFront cache for that URL so that updates propagate. This would be invoked during admin operations, not by end-user action, so it can be offline or via an internal tool.

7. Payments Flow

Payments are handled through Stripe to leverage a PCI-compliant provider and provide smooth customer experiences. We integrate Stripe using a combination of client-side and server-side processes, ensuring security (no raw card data on our servers) and reliability (using idempotency and webhooks).

Here’s the typical payment flow from seat selection to confirmation, with a sequence diagram:

sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App as Mobile App (Client)
    participant API as Ticketing API (Server)
    participant Stripe as Stripe API
    participant Worker as Outbox Worker

    User->>App: Selects seats and taps "Buy"
    App->>API: **POST** /orders (with event & seat IDs, etc.)
    Note over API: Verify seat holds & create Order in DB
    API->>Stripe: Create PaymentIntent (amount, orderId) via API
    Stripe-->>API: PaymentIntent ID + client_secret
    API->>PostgreSQL: Save Order (PendingPayment, PI attached)
    API-->>App: Order created (orderId + client_secret returned)
    App->>Stripe: Confirm PaymentIntent (using client_secret and card details)
    Stripe-->>Stripe: (Processes payment, possibly 3DS challenge)
    Stripe->>API: **POST** /payments/webhooks (payment_intent.succeeded)
    API->>API: Verify Stripe signature & enqueue event
    API->>PostgreSQL: INSERT into stripe_events (event_id, type, orderId, processed=false)
    API-->>Stripe: 200 OK (acknowledge receipt)
    Worker-->>PostgreSQL: Poll stripe_events for new events
    Worker->>PostgreSQL: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED (grabs event)
    Worker->>PostgreSQL: UPDATE orders SET status='CONFIRMED', updated_at=NOW() WHERE id = <orderId>;
    Worker->>PostgreSQL: UPDATE event_seats SET status='PAID', version=version+1 WHERE order_id=<orderId>;
    Worker->>PostgreSQL: INSERT order_audit_log (orderId, from=PENDING, to=CONFIRMED, time)
    Worker->>PostgreSQL: UPDATE stripe_events SET processed=true WHERE event_id=<id>;
    Worker->>PostgreSQL: COMMIT;  -- All done atomically
    Worker-->>User: (via Push/SMS/Email) Ticket purchase confirmed!

Client- vs Server-side PaymentIntent:
We have two options to create the Stripe PaymentIntent:
	•	Server-side (recommended): Our API (on POST /orders) calls Stripe to create the PaymentIntent with the exact amount and order info. We then send the client_secret to the client. The mobile app uses that client_secret with Stripe’s SDK to handle card input and confirmation. This keeps amount/source of truth on our side and allows us to set things like description, metadata (orderId) in the PaymentIntent. We use a Stripe idempotency key (like orderId) when creating the intent to avoid duplicates on retry.
	•	Client-side creation: Alternatively, the mobile app could directly create a PaymentIntent via Stripe’s public API (using publishable key) and send us the PaymentIntent ID. In that case, POST /orders would accept a payment_intent_id that the client already created. We would verify it (maybe fetch it via Stripe API to confirm amount matches, etc.) and attach to order. This offloads some load from our server, but it’s more complex to verify and less control. We lean towards server-side creation for simplicity and control.

Webhook Verification: As shown, when Stripe calls our webhook:
	•	We use the Stripe library or our own HMAC check to verify the signature using the webhook secret. If verification fails, we return 400 (bad request) and do not process (to avoid spoofed events).
	•	We also may check that the event’s livemode flag matches our environment (to ensure we don’t accidentally process test events in prod or vice versa).
	•	Only after verification do we insert into stripe_events. This ensures we only process legitimate events.

Handling Payment Confirmation Delay: In most cases, the PaymentIntent will be confirmed within seconds. The app can listen for either the webhook (if app has a real-time channel) or poll the order status. We will implement push notifications (see Mobile section) so that upon order confirmation, the user gets an alert/ticket. If Stripe requires additional authentication (3D Secure), the Stripe SDK will handle that flow with the user (presenting a verification UI), and only after completion will the payment_intent.succeeded come.

We also handle payment failure events:
	•	If payment_intent.payment_failed comes, our webhook can mark the Order as CANCELED (or a specific ‘PAYMENT_FAILED’ status) and free the seats. This is tricky timing: if payment fails within the hold TTL, we can immediately release seats for others. The outbox worker would update order to canceled, then a process to release seats (update event_seats status to AVAILABLE, bump version).
	•	The client, via Stripe SDK, would get an error on payment (so they know it failed and can show an error to user). Our system’s update just ensures consistency and maybe sends an “Payment failed, order canceled” notification.

Refunds / Chargebacks: Webhooks will also notify if a charge is refunded or a chargeback (charge.dispute.created). Those can be handled in Payments context:
	•	For a refund, if we initiated it, we mark order as REFUNDED (and possibly trigger making that seat available again if within time window or mark it for resale).
	•	Chargebacks might require marking the order in a dispute state for manual handling.

Stripe Rate Limits and Throughput: Stripe can handle a high volume of PaymentIntent creation, but to be safe, we use their idempotency and handle 429 responses by backing off. Creating 2k PaymentIntents per second (our max write throughput) is high but Stripe should handle it with appropriate account limits. We might batch or pre-create PaymentIntents if expecting a huge spike, but generally, on-sales convert to orders at a slower rate than holds (not everyone who holds will buy). We assume the payment creation rate is manageable.

Outbox Worker Details:
	•	It runs continuously (could be a separate service or a background thread in the API app). We ensure only one instance of the worker processes a given event by using FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED which locks rows so other worker instances skip them. We can run multiple worker threads to increase throughput of processing webhooks if needed.
	•	We tune the polling interval or use a DB notification (listen/notify on new inserts) to trigger immediate processing.
	•	Graceful shutdown: The worker will finish processing current batch then stop, ensuring at least once processing (if it stops mid-event, that event remains unprocessed and will be picked up on restart).

Idempotency with Stripe: We set an idempotency key on critical Stripe API calls (like create PaymentIntent keyed by our orderId) to avoid creating multiple intents for the same order on retries. Stripe will then return the same intent if the key is reused, preventing double charges.

Testing Payment Flow: In sandbox mode, we’ll use Stripe test API keys and generate events to ensure our webhook and outbox works properly before going live. Also make sure to handle Stripe’s habit of sending events out of order occasionally (e.g., sometimes a charge.succeeded might come just before the payment_intent.succeeded; our logic should ideally handle the relevant ones we need).

In summary, the Payments integration is designed to never block the main user flow (everything after order creation happens asynchronously via webhook to confirm). The user experience is: they hold seats, create order (fast operation), then they complete payment via Stripe’s UI – if success, they get confirmation (maybe instantly if we optimistically mark it, or within a second or two via push). By not waiting on Stripe inside our order transaction, we keep our 99th percentile latency low (<600ms for order creation without external calls).

8. Mobile Architecture

Our platform targets native mobile clients (iOS and Android) to ensure optimal performance and user experience, especially during high-demand on-sales where web apps might falter. The mobile architecture includes SDKs generated from the OpenAPI spec, robust offline support, and secure handling of user credentials and tokens.

Native SDKs from OpenAPI

We maintain an up-to-date OpenAPI (Swagger) specification of our REST API. From this spec, we generate client libraries:
	•	iOS SDK: Using tools like Swagger Codegen or OpenAPI Generator with a Swift5 template (or Apple’s new Swift OpenAPI generator if available). This produces a Swift package that models the API endpoints as Swift functions/data models. We might wrap these in higher-level convenience methods for common flows.
	•	Android SDK: Similarly, using OpenAPI Generator for Kotlin (perhaps with a Kotlin Coroutine and Retrofit/OkHttp stack). This yields a library with Kotlin data classes for requests/responses and service interfaces for each API group.

By generating SDKs, we ensure consistency with the server API and reduce manual coding. We will still write some custom code around it for:
	•	Token management: inject Authorization header in each request (the generated code often allows an auth interceptor or callback to add JWT to headers).
	•	Network configuration: base URLs, timeouts, logging (for debugging).
	•	Concurrency: on iOS, perhaps integrate with Combine or async/await; on Kotlin, use coroutines for async calls.

Auth Token Handling

Access Tokens (JWT): Short-lived (15 min) JWTs are used for all API calls (Authorization: Bearer token). These contain minimal info (user id, tenant, roles, exp).
	•	On mobile, we store the JWT in memory (or Keychain if needed, but since it expires quickly, memory is okay). We refresh it as needed.
	•	We validate the JWT on each API call server-side (signature + expiration).

Refresh Tokens: Long-lived opaque tokens to get new JWTs.
	•	These are treated like a password equivalent, so on mobile we store them in a secure enclave:
	•	iOS: Store in Keychain with kSecClassGenericPassword accessible only to the app.
	•	Android: Use EncryptedSharedPreferences or Android Keystore system to store securely.
	•	When the app launches, if a refresh token is present, it attempts /auth/refresh to get a new JWT (silent login).
	•	We implement refresh token rotation: After each successful refresh, the server issues a new refresh token and the mobile app updates the stored token. This limits reuse. The old token is invalidated on server (if someone tries to reuse it, the server will know it’s already used – indicating possible theft – and can refuse with an error forcing re-login).
	•	The SDK’s networking layer can watch for 401 Unauthorized responses. If a request fails due to token expiration, the SDK will:
	1.	Pause outgoing requests (or let them fail temporarily),
	2.	Call /auth/refresh using the refresh token (once),
	3.	If refresh succeeds, store new tokens and retry the original request.
	4.	If refresh fails (refresh token invalid/expired), it will not retry further – instead, it triggers a logout flow (e.g., notify the app to present login screen).
	•	We must also handle refresh in background for long-running apps: e.g., if user has the app open for an hour, their token will expire after 15m. We either proactively refresh (e.g., 5 minutes before expiration, the app can call refresh in background) or just do it on demand when an API call fails. A proactive approach can use a background task or timer.

Offline-Friendliness

We want the app to be resilient to poor connectivity:
	•	Caching of GET requests: The SDK can cache certain GET responses in a local database (or just memory/disk) so that viewing events or previously purchased tickets is possible offline. For example:
	•	Event list and details can be cached so the user can at least see event info without network.
	•	Seat map data (layout JSON or image) can be downloaded and cached the first time, so if the user goes offline or the venue has poor reception, the seat map still displays. (This is especially important for showing the ticket QR code or seat info at the venue.)
	•	The user’s tickets (orders): after a purchase, the app should save the ticket details (seat, QR code) locally so it can be shown even if the network is down at the gate.
	•	Local storage: Use Core Data/SQLite or simple file storage for caching. On iOS, perhaps use NSCache for in-memory plus file for persistence. On Android, Room or SQLite for structured data.
	•	Read-through caching strategy: The SDK can provide methods like getMyOrders() that first return cached data immediately (if available) then refresh from network and update the UI. This way, if offline, at least cached orders show.
	•	Write operations offline: It’s generally not possible to complete a purchase entirely offline (since needs server for locking seats and Stripe payment). But we can queue certain actions. For example, if user is offline and tries to add something to a wishlist or something non-critical, the app could queue and send later. For core flows like purchase, we will require connectivity.
	•	Graceful degradation: If connectivity is lost during purchase, the app should inform the user that the purchase could not be completed and possibly resume if regained (maybe by checking if an order was created or not when back online).

Push Notifications

Real-time updates are important for a good experience:
	•	We integrate with APNs (Apple Push Notification service) for iOS and FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for Android.
	•	When the user logs in, we register the device for push and send the device token to our backend (e.g., POST /users/{id}/push-token).
	•	We send notifications for events like:
	•	Order confirmed: “Your order #1234 is confirmed! 4 tickets for Event X.”
	•	Order failed: “Payment failed for your order. Your seats have been released.”
	•	If implementing a waiting room/queue: “It’s your turn! You can now select tickets for Event X.”
	•	Maybe reminders: “Event starts in 1 hour, here’s your ticket.”
	•	The push payload might include an order ID or event ID so the app can navigate the user to the right screen.
	•	We ensure these notifications are data notifications (with relevant IDs) rather than just text, allowing the app to fetch updated info if needed when opened.

Security note: We don’t include extremely sensitive info in push (like personal data or full ticket QR codes) because push notifications can be intercepted on device if not handled carefully. Usually just IDs and let app fetch details securely.

Platform-specific considerations
	•	iOS (Swift): We can leverage newer SwiftUI/Combine or async/await. The SDK generation may produce a lot of boilerplate; we might write a wrapper class TicketingAPIClient that provides simpler methods. For example:

class TicketingAPIClient {
    static let shared = TicketingAPIClient()
    private let api = GeneratedAPI(basePath: "https://api.example.com")
    
    init() {
       // configure auth interceptor
       api.customHeaders["Authorization"] = { "Bearer \(AuthManager.shared.accessToken)" }
    }
    
    func refreshSession(completion: @escaping (Result<Void, Error>) -> Void) {
       AuthAPI.refreshToken(refreshToken: Keychain.refreshToken) { result in
           // handle storing new token or error
       }
    }
    
    func holdSeats(eventId: UUID, seatIds: [UUID], completion: @escaping (Result<HoldResponse, Error>) -> Void) {
       SeatsAPI.holdSeats(eventId: eventId, seatHoldRequest: SeatHoldRequest(seatIds: seatIds)) { response, error in
           // map to Result and return
       }
    }
    
    func createOrder(eventId: UUID, seatIds: [UUID], paymentMethod: String, completion: @escaping (Result<OrderConfirmation, Error>) -> Void) {
       let req = CreateOrderRequest(eventId: eventId, seatIds: seatIds, paymentMethod: paymentMethod)
       OrdersAPI.createOrder(createOrderRequest: req) { order, error in ... }
    }
}

This shows stubs for key operations. In practice, we’d integrate strongly with Stripe’s iOS SDK for the paymentMethod step (e.g., collecting card details and obtaining a PaymentMethod ID or using STPPaymentHandler to handle confirmation with the client secret).
	•	Android (Kotlin): Similar approach, using coroutines for async:

object TicketingClient {
    private val api = GeneratedApiClient(baseUrl = "https://api.example.com", authTokenProvider = { AuthManager.token })
    
    suspend fun holdSeats(eventId: UUID, seatIds: List<UUID>): HoldResult {
        val request = SeatHoldRequest(eventId, seatIds)
        return api.seatsApi.holdSeats(request)  // assume this uses suspend functions
    }
    
    suspend fun createOrder(eventId: UUID, seatIds: List<UUID>, paymentMethod: String?): OrderConfirmation {
        val req = CreateOrderRequest(eventId, seatIds, paymentMethod)
        return api.ordersApi.createOrder(req)
    }
    
    suspend fun refreshToken(): Boolean {
        return try {
            val newTokens = api.authApi.refreshToken(AuthManager.refreshToken)
            AuthManager.updateTokens(newTokens)
            true
        } catch(e: ApiException) {
            false
        }
    }
}

We ensure thread-safety and lifecycle awareness on Android (calling these from ViewModel scopes, etc.).

Secure Storage & Background Refresh
	•	The refresh token as mentioned is stored in Keychain/AndroidKeystore. Access to it is restricted (iOS can use .afterFirstUnlock accessibility so it’s available after unlock).
	•	We implement background token refresh as needed. On iOS, we could use BackgroundTasks or simply refresh on app foreground if expired. On Android, WorkManager could schedule a periodic task to refresh if needed (though if app is not run for long, token might expire and user may need to log in again – that’s acceptable).
	•	The mobile apps must handle the case of expired refresh token (maybe if user hasn’t opened app in a month) by gracefully redirecting to login.
	•	We also consider biometric auth for app entry if required (not strictly needed unless storing highly sensitive info; but as a nice-to-have, user could lock the app with FaceID before showing tickets).

Performance & UX during On-Sale
	•	The apps should be prepared for the scenario of a queue. If our anti-bot measures put the user in a queue, the API might return a 429 with a “queue position” or a token for a queue. The app should detect that and perhaps show a “Waiting room” UI with periodic refresh.
	•	Once allowed, user will get through to hold seats.
	•	The seat selection UI should handle real-time feedback: e.g., if a seat selection fails (409 conflict), highlight that seat as just taken by someone else.
	•	Possibly, implement slight delays or disable rapid multi-clicks to avoid sending too many hold requests (to play nicely with rate limiting).
	•	Use push or long-polling to get notifications if an order was confirmed (in case user navigated away from the app during processing).
	•	Ensure the seat map rendering is efficient (if a venue has thousands of seats, drawing them might be heavy on mobile; consider using tiling or simplifying the view, or only rendering a portion at a time).

By providing robust SDKs and handling all the tricky parts (auth, retries, caching) within them, we make life easier for our app developers and ensure that the client experience remains smooth even under stress (no one wants an app freeze during a Taylor Swift on-sale!). The native approach (vs. web) avoids issues with web view performance and gives us more control over caching and offline access (e.g., storing tickets locally for offline entry scanning).

9. Non-Functional Requirements

Beyond the functional design, we must meet stringent non-functional requirements for scale, performance, security, and observability. Here we outline how the system meets those targets:

Scalability & Performance
	•	Target Load: The system is built to handle 200,000+ concurrent users during on-sales, with at least 2,000 writes/sec (seat holds, order creations) and 10,000 reads/sec (loading seat maps, polling status) per region. Bursts may reach 5× these rates for short periods.
	•	Horizontal Scaling: All stateless services (API servers, workers) can be scaled out. During a big on-sale, we can ramp up many application instances across multiple availability zones. Each instance will maintain only lightweight in-memory state (caches, etc.), so new instances can join or leave without disruption.
	•	We use auto-scaling triggers: CPU, memory, or better, QPS and queue metrics to scale the number of app pods.
	•	The database is the main bottleneck; see below for scaling it.
	•	Database Scaling: PostgreSQL will be tuned for high write throughput:
	•	Use a powerful primary node (e.g., Amazon Aurora cluster with multiple read replicas).
	•	Offload reads to replicas or caching: All read-heavy endpoints (event info, seat map, availability queries) either use caches or can read from replicas. The primary handles writes (holds, orders). Aurora’s design can handle bursts of writes, but we will monitor for contention.
	•	Partitioning: If necessary, we can partition some tables by event or tenant (for example, event_seats by event_id range or by venue) to reduce contention. But initially, given one event’s seats might all contend on one table, partitioning per event might isolate locks per event (which is good if multiple on-sales happen simultaneously). PostgreSQL partitioning or separate schema per tenant could be explored if needed in Phase 3.
	•	Caching/CDN: Using CDN for static content (venue layouts) takes significant load off application servers. E.g., 10k read rps might mostly be users downloading seat map images/JSON which CloudFront handles. The API responses for layout could even be cached at edge (with proper cache-control) if they are truly static.
	•	We also cache reference data like venue info, event list, etc., either at CDN or application memory/Redis, as they change rarely.
	•	Hot path dynamic reads (like availability) might not be cacheable globally because they change too often, but we can cache a last known snapshot for a second or two if needed to shave off load (with careful invalidation when seats are sold).
	•	Latency SLOs:
	•	Reads: P99 < 300ms. Most GET requests (event info, seat map) should be served from cache or local data, well under 300ms. Even hitting the DB (with proper indexes) for a single-row lookup (like order status) is <50ms typically, leaving plenty of headroom for network latency.
	•	Writes: P99 < 600ms (excluding payment processing). This includes seat hold and order creation:
	•	Seat hold: primarily a Redis call (sub-millisecond) and a quick DB version update – should be ~50ms normally; under heavy contention maybe a bit more, but aiming to keep 99th under 0.6s by avoiding slow locks.
	•	Order creation: involves a few DB inserts/updates and maybe a Stripe call. We exclude Stripe’s latency (since the SLO says excluding third-party), so our internal part (DB transaction) must be quick (<200ms). Stripe call might add 100-300ms, but that’s out-of-scope for SLO. We ensure not to lock others while waiting for Stripe.
	•	We use async processing for anything heavy or third-party (webhooks) to keep user-facing calls fast.
	•	Connection Management: 200k users might imply a lot of open connections. We cannot have 200k DB connections, so:
	•	Use a connection pool with a reasonable size (e.g., 100) per app instance and multiplex queries. Utilize an intermediary like PgBouncer if needed for pooling at scale.
	•	Similarly, for Redis, use a pool or cluster that can handle many ops per second; Redis itself can handle tens of thousands of ops/sec per core.
	•	The HTTP layer (Load Balancer, etc.) will handle many concurrent keep-alive connections from clients. We should ensure to enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for multiplexing to reduce connection overhead for mobile clients.
	•	Capacity Estimation:
	•	App servers: Suppose one app instance on average can handle X RPS. If our target is 10k rps reads and 2k rps writes = 12k total, and let’s assume a single instance can do ~300 RPS (this depends on CPU, code efficiency, etc., but a modern 4 vCPU instance might do 300-500 lightweight requests/sec). We might need on the order of 40-50 instances to comfortably handle 12k RPS (with headroom). We will load-test to get actual numbers.
	•	Postgres: 2k writes/sec, if each order involves ~3-4 queries (one insert order, multiple inserts lines, update seats) that might be ~10k queries/sec on primary. A high-end AWS Aurora can handle that on a decent instance size (db.r5.large or bigger). We also tune PG: increase max_connections (with pooling), tune checkpoint and WAL settings for sustained writes, possibly use a larger buffer pool to keep hot tables (like event_seats) in memory.
	•	Disk IOPS might be a factor if writing audit logs heavily; we might put audit logs on a separate write-optimized table or even separate DB (since it’s not in critical path).
	•	MongoDB: Seat map loads are occasional and mostly read. We can scale Mongo with read replicas and put it close to the app region. The seat map JSON could be a few MB for a big stadium; that’s fine over CDN. Writes to Mongo (publishing layouts) are rare (admin operations).
	•	Redis: Each seat hold is a write to Redis and an expire. At 2k/sec holds, Redis easily handles that (2k ops/sec is trivial). Even at peak 10k ops/sec for short bursts (if many holds and releases), a single modern Redis instance can do >100k ops/sec. We will run a Redis cluster (with primary-replica) for HA. Memory: each lock key ~ some bytes. If 50k seats held concurrently (extremely high scenario), it’s 50k keys, which is negligible in memory (~ a few MB). We just must ensure proper eviction policy for any caches (we’ll use explicit TTL, so keys will drop off).
	•	Graceful Degradation: We plan for scenarios where load exceeds capacity:
	•	If writes become too slow (approaching that 600ms threshold or timing out), instead of failing in chaos, we might temporarily throttle new seat hold requests. This could be done by activating a waiting room (if not already in place) or sending back a 503 Server Busy - please retry/queue. We prefer controlled queueing (letting users in gradually as capacity frees up) rather than random failures.
	•	Read-only mode: In a severe case (e.g., DB down or in maintenance), we can put the system in “read-only” where browsing events is allowed but new orders are paused. The API can return a specific error code/message indicating maintenance. Because of our feature flag system, we can toggle such mode.
	•	For partial outages: e.g., if Redis is down, we might disable new holds (since locking can’t function) and show a friendly error that “ticket purchasing is temporarily paused”. Users already in checkout might either proceed at risk or also be blocked. This is obviously last resort; in practice we’d ensure high availability of Redis (clustering, etc., to avoid downtime).

Anti-Bot and Abuse Mitigations

High-demand ticket sales attract bots and scalpers. We implement multiple layers of defense:
	•	Proof-of-Work (PoW): For critical endpoints like acquiring a seat hold during on-sale, we can require a PoW token. For example, the client must compute a hash puzzle (e.g., finding a nonce so that sha256(userId + timestamp + nonce) has a certain number of leading zeros). This puzzle takes, say, a few seconds for a client but is infeasible to do in bulk quickly. The API /seats/hold would accept a PoW token and verify it. Legitimate apps will do this in background (we can adjust difficulty dynamically).
	•	Attestation (Device Integrity): We can integrate with services like App Attest (iOS) or SafetyNet/Play Integrity (Android) to ensure the API calls come from genuine apps, not automated scripts. The client obtains an attestation and the API verifies it. This helps block basic bots or scripts not running on real devices.
	•	Dynamic Rate Limiting: We apply rate limits per IP and per user:
	•	e.g., no more than 5 seat hold attempts per second per user, or 50 per minute, etc. If exceeded, respond 429. This prevents a single user or bot from hogging tries.
	•	At the network edge (e.g., Cloudflare or AWS WAF), rate-limit by IP address too. However, since legitimate users might come through NATs (mobile carriers) we must be cautious. We can use a combination of IP + user-agent fingerprint.
	•	Our anti-bot can automatically tighten limits when an event is extremely popular. (For instance, detect if thousands of attempts coming from one IP range).
	•	Queue (Virtual Waiting Room): For the largest on-sales, even 200k concurrent might be too high to give everyone immediate access. We integrate a waiting room:
	•	Before allowing seat selection, users get a queue token. We can have a service (or use a vendor like Queue-it, or a simple in-house solution) that assigns a random queue number to each session. Users wait and are admitted in batches (throttled to, say, 1000 new users per minute) to ensure the system isn’t overwhelmed.
	•	Implementation: When user opens the event at on-sale time, the API might return “queued” status with an approximate wait number or time. The client shows a countdown or number. When their turn comes, the server issues a one-time token (or simply the user’s session is marked as active) that allows them to proceed to selecting seats.
	•	This is a complex but effective throttle – by smoothing the spike over time.
	•	This can be activated via feature flag for extremely high-demand events.
	•	Monitoring & Bot Detection: We log anomalies: e.g., a single user account trying to hold hundreds of seats (maybe using multiple devices) or many failures that might indicate a bot trying random seats. We could temporarily block or require captcha for that user.
	•	Possibly employ CAPTCHA or email/SMS verification at account creation to prevent mass fake accounts.
	•	Device limits: Limit how many devices can use the same account simultaneously for holding seats. If we detect 5 devices on one account all trying different seats, likely abuse – we can invalidate some.

Observability (Metrics, Logs, Tracing)

We include a comprehensive observability setup from the start:
	•	Metrics: We will instrument the code to record key metrics, using something like Prometheus (if self-hosted) or CloudWatch metrics on AWS. Important metrics:
	•	Lock contention: e.g., seat_lock_conflicts_total (counter) every time a seat hold fails due to lock held by someone else. A high rate indicates a popular event or a problem if too high relative to success.
	•	Lock wait time: (if we implement waiting) or average time to acquire lock if we ever queue internally.
	•	Successful holds and releases: counters to track how many holds are happening.
	•	Order creation rate: orders_created_total, and perhaps a gauge of active pending orders.
	•	Payment outcomes: payment_success_total, payment_failure_total.
	•	Outbox lag: measure difference between stripe_event received_at and processed time – we can export a metric for max lag in seconds, or count of events waiting. E.g., stripe_outbox_lag_seconds (could be a histogram).
	•	Webhook retries: count if we ever see duplicates (indicating we didn’t ack fast enough or processing slow).
	•	DB performance: e.g., number of deadlocks or rollbacks if any (Postgres can report those).
	•	Redis stats: we can track Redis latency or errors. Also number of active keys in certain namespace if needed.
	•	JWT refresh reuse: a counter if we detect a refresh token reuse attack (this would trigger security alert).
	•	API latency: histogram per endpoint or at least overall, to ensure we meet SLOs (e.g., p95, p99 tracking).
	•	Cache hit rate: e.g., for any in-app caches or CDN hit/miss (CDN provides logs, but for internal cache, e.g., if we cache layout in Redis, track hits vs misses).
	•	Queue/Wait stats: if using a waiting room, measure current queue length, throughput of admissions.
	•	User drop-off: maybe track how many holds do not lead to orders (to gauge conversion).
	•	System resource metrics: CPU, memory of servers (often handled by infra monitoring).
	•	Logging: Use structured logging (JSON logs) with essential context:
	•	Include a request_id (correlation ID) for each API request (clients can also send one, or we generate) to trace a flow across services.
	•	Include user_id and session_id in logs when available (but careful about PII – user_id is okay if UUID, no names).
	•	order_id, event_id in logs for order processing steps.
	•	Logs for important events: e.g., “Seat hold acquired” with seat id and user, “Order created”, “Payment confirmed” etc., to allow audit trails.
	•	We’ll integrate with a log aggregator (like ELK stack or CloudWatch Logs) to search and alert on certain patterns (e.g., errors, or certain high-severity logs).
	•	Tracing: We adopt distributed tracing to pinpoint performance issues across components:
	•	We propagate a trace context (following W3C Traceparent header or similar) from the client (the mobile SDK can generate a trace-id for a user action) to the server and through to downstream calls (e.g., Stripe calls if possible, or at least log them).
	•	Each API request trace will include spans for DB queries, Redis operations, external calls. Tools like OpenTelemetry can be used with an exporter (Jaeger, X-Ray, etc.).
	•	This helps find, say, if a particular query is slow or if external call delaying things.
	•	Alerting: Based on metrics and logs, we set up alerts:
	•	If P95/P99 latency exceeds thresholds for a sustained period.
	•	If error rate (5xx or specific 4xx like conflicts) spikes beyond expected (maybe indicates an issue if too many stale locks = possible bug or too low TTL).
	•	If outbox lag goes above X seconds (maybe Stripe issues or worker down).
	•	If DB connections saturate or CPU near max.
	•	If Redis memory nearly full or connection errors.
	•	Security alerts: multiple refresh token reuse events -> possible breach, alert security.
	•	Testing Observability: We include in our test plan to simulate certain conditions and ensure metrics/logs capture them (e.g., simulate a deadlock and see if metric shows it, etc.).

Security & Compliance

Handling payments and personal data requires strong security posture:
	•	PCI Compliance: By using Stripe’s hosted flows or mobile SDK, our servers do not see full card numbers or CVV, reducing our PCI scope significantly (likely to SAQ A or A-EP at most). We still must protect any payment data we store:
	•	We might store last4 of card or brand (for receipt) – treat it as sensitive (encrypt at rest).
	•	The Stripe PaymentIntent ID or customer ID is not sensitive itself, but we guard API keys that can access it.
	•	Secret Management: All sensitive credentials (Stripe API keys, JWT signing keys, database passwords) are stored securely (in AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables on Fly, but not in code or repo). We rotate keys regularly:
	•	JWT signing key rotation could be handled by maintaining a key set (old key and new key during rotation period).
	•	Stripe keys rotation: Stripe provides roll keys mechanism; we can update config with new keys and revoke old.
	•	Data Encryption:
	•	Ensure all data at rest is encrypted: RDS (Postgres) encryption, MongoDB volume encryption, Redis (if on SSD) encryption. This is usually provided by cloud by default.
	•	In transit: All external communication uses TLS (HTTPS for API, TLS for DB connections and Redis if cross-network, etc.). Internally within a VPC, still use TLS if possible.
	•	Access Control: We enforce authorization at multiple levels:
	•	Tenancy: If our platform serves multiple client organizations, each API call checks that the user’s tenant matches the resource (e.g., an org admin from OrgA can’t access OrgB’s event or orders). Tenant ID in JWT helps here.
	•	Roles: Endpoints like adding events or issuing refunds require appropriate role (admin or financial role). We define roles in JWT or fetch from DB and check in the application layer.
	•	Principle of least privilege: database users have only necessary privileges; e.g., the app’s DB user might not be superuser, just enough to run needed queries. If using multiple schemas or databases, even separate credentials per context could be considered (though one DB simplifies it).
	•	Input Validation: All API inputs are validated to prevent injection or malicious data:
	•	Use parameterized queries in SQL (ORM or Query builder does this) to avoid SQL injection.
	•	Validate IDs are proper UUIDs, lengths of strings, allowed characters (especially for anything that might be used in queries or file paths).
	•	Stripe webhooks: we only parse after verifying signature to avoid processing malicious payloads.
	•	Audit and Compliance: We maintain the audit log for orders. Additionally:
	•	Log admin actions (if there’s an admin portal to e.g. create events or release tickets).
	•	Keep an audit of security-related events (logins, refresh usage, token revocations).
	•	Comply with GDPR: allow data deletion for users (which means deleting personal info but maybe keep order records anonymized for financial records).
	•	PII minimization: don’t collect unnecessary info. For example, we might not store full address unless needed for box office pickup. Focus on email, maybe phone (for mobile tickets), and payment goes through Stripe (we store minimal).
	•	GDPR/CCPA requests: Provide mechanisms to export or delete user data upon request. Because orders are financial transactions, we might not be able to delete an order entirely (for legal), but we can anonymize personal fields.
	•	Session Security: The refresh token strategy with rotation and secure storage prevents many attacks:
	•	Short JWT lifespan limits window if stolen.
	•	Refresh token replay detection logs out all sessions for that user if triggered.
	•	Use secure communication always (on mobile, all APIs are HTTPS, and pins to our domain; could even use certificate pinning in app to prevent MITM on public WiFi).
	•	Rate-limit login attempts to avoid brute force.
	•	Possibly use 2FA for high-value accounts (admins).
	•	Pentesting: We will have periodic penetration tests and code security reviews, especially before handling real payments.

In sum, our non-functional approach ensures the system will perform under load, degrade gracefully, remain secure from threats, and be observable such that issues can be detected and resolved quickly.

10. Testing & Rollout

To confidently launch this platform, we implement a thorough testing strategy and a careful rollout plan with phased releases and safeguards.

Testing Strategy
	•	Unit Testing: We write unit tests for domain logic and utility functions. All FSM transitions (seat and order state changes) get unit tests to ensure valid transitions succeed and invalid ones throw errors. For example, test that you cannot reserve a seat that’s not held, test that confirming an already confirmed order is idempotent/no-op, etc. Also test calculations like pricing, version increments, etc., in isolation (using a mock repository or in-memory).
	•	Integration Testing: These tests verify interactions between components using real or simulated external systems:
	•	Use an in-memory PostgreSQL (or testcontainer) to run through a flow: e.g., a test that simulates a full purchase: hold seats (calls Redis, or we use a Stub Redis that approximates), create order (writing to Postgres), simulate Stripe webhook (calling the webhook endpoint), then verify order status in DB. We might spin up ephemeral Redis and Postgres instances for such tests (using Docker or embedded libraries).
	•	Integration with Stripe: We can use Stripe’s test mode API in tests. For example, a test could call createPaymentIntent via our StripePort with a special test card that triggers an immediate successful payment, then call our webhook handler with a fake event (Stripe allows sending test webhooks or we can simulate the DB insert).
	•	Test the Redis Lua script for multi-lock acquisition in a controlled environment to ensure it sets keys atomically.
	•	Test what happens on lock expiration: e.g., hold a seat, then simulate TTL expiry (maybe manipulate Redis time or a shorter TTL) and then attempt an order, expecting a failure.
	•	Contract Testing: Since we generate SDKs from the OpenAPI, it’s crucial the API matches the spec. We can use tools like Dredd or Schemathesis to test our API endpoints against the OpenAPI spec to ensure our responses conform (e.g., all required fields present, types correct). Also, we ensure the spec is updated whenever code changes.
	•	Additionally, contract tests between components: e.g., if we ever separate microservices (not in initial design, but say a separate payments service), contract tests ensure their integration.
	•	Performance Testing (Load tests): We simulate on-sale scenarios using tools like k6, Gatling, or Artillery:
	•	Script a scenario where X users hit the system: e.g., 50k users enter waiting room, then 1k of them per minute start selecting seats. They call /seats/hold (some fraction fail due to contention), then proceed to /orders and we simulate payment webhook. We measure if the system keeps up (latencies under SLO, no crashing).
	•	We’ll perform these tests in a staging environment with scaled-down numbers first (like 5k users, 200 rps) and then scale up gradually. We’ll identify bottlenecks: e.g., perhaps DB CPU goes high or lock conflicts increase beyond expectation.
	•	We also test specific heavy operations: e.g., what if one user tries to hold 500 seats (if somehow allowed) – ensure bulk hold either is limited or performs.
	•	Use these tests to fine-tune timeouts, thread pools, DB indexes, etc. For instance, we might find the seat selection query needs an additional index for performance.
	•	Chaos Testing (Game Days): Simulate failures to verify resilience:
	•	Redis outage: We can take Redis down in a test/staging environment during an on-sale simulation. The expected behavior: seat holds start failing (as we can’t lock). The application should handle Redis connection errors gracefully (return a 503 or custom error instead of hanging). After Redis is back, the system should recover (maybe some users lost their holds). We ensure no data corruption: e.g., if Redis went down after some seats reserved in DB but before locks could be released, our compensator or design should handle those (most likely by virtue that DB has them reserved, so they aren’t lost).
	•	Stripe latency spike: Simulate Stripe taking 10 seconds to create PaymentIntent or send webhook. Our order creation should not wait (we decouple it). But ensure we handle eventual webhook that might come late. Also if Stripe is slow to respond on PaymentIntent creation in /orders call and we did decide to call it synchronously, ensure the client doesn’t timeout (maybe set a slightly higher timeout or, as we planned, ideally do it after responding to client).
	•	Postgres failover: In staging, force a failover (if using Aurora or a replica promotion). Our app’s connection pool should detect the connection break and reconnect to the new primary. We test during active traffic to see if any requests fail and ensure they retry. Ideally, use a DB proxy or the Aurora endpoint that handles failover so that app just reconnects seamlessly. We still might see a few second pause – our app/pool config should be set to retry queries on transient errors if possible.
	•	Network partition: Simulate network lag or loss between app and DB or app and Redis. Ensure timeouts are in place so threads don’t hang forever, and that when recovered, system resumes.
	•	High contention scenario: All users want the same few seats (e.g., front row). We simulate, and expect many 409 conflicts. Ensure the system and clients handle that volume of conflicts (these are not errors per se, just business outcome). The server should still remain stable (lots of conflicts should not, say, lock up the DB – our approach with Redis should prevent heavy DB locking).
	•	CI/CD Pipeline Tests: We integrate all the above in CI:
	•	Run unit and integration tests on each commit.
	•	Possibly run a subset of load tests nightly or on major merges (maybe not full 200k user simulation, but a smaller stress test to catch performance regressions).
	•	Database migration tests: We treat migrations seriously – since only forward migrations allowed, we test that applying new migrations on a copy of prod schema doesn’t lose data. Also check for long-running migrations (adding an index on a huge table can lock it; we plan to add those with CONCURRENTLY where possible). Our CI could use a tool to detect if a migration is potentially unsafe (some teams use linters for this).
	•	Ensure OpenAPI doc is up-to-date: maybe in CI we generate an API client from the spec and compile it against the code (if using something like springdoc, it’s automatic; if manually maintained, we at least eyeball changes).
	•	After deployment to a staging environment, run an automated end-to-end test: e.g., spin up a headless app or just use HTTP calls to simulate a user journey: create user -> login -> hold seat -> create order -> simulate webhook -> get order -> logout. This ensures the whole pipeline works in the deployed environment (with actual DB, etc.).
	•	Use feature flags toggled in staging to test new features (like the waiting room) without affecting others.

Rollout and Deployment

We will roll out in phases (detailed in section 11) to gradually deliver functionality. For each phase and feature:
	•	Feature Flags: We build toggles for risky features (ex: enable/disable the waiting room, switch between active-passive vs active-active mode, enable resale feature, etc.). This allows us to deploy code but turn features on gradually or turn off if issues arise.
	•	Incremental Rollout: For mobile app features, we might do a staged rollout on app stores (e.g., release to 10% of users, then 50%, then 100%) to catch any client-side issues early.
	•	Blue/Green Deployments: On server side, we can have two environments (blue and green) and switch traffic between them for zero-downtime deploys. Or use rolling deployments with enough instances so that some handle traffic while others update.
	•	Backward compatibility: Since mobile clients may not all update immediately, our API should maintain backward compatibility for at least some time. If we change an endpoint contract (e.g., adding required fields), we either version the API or make new fields optional. We aim to avoid breaking changes in the API. If needed, support two API versions during a transition.
	•	Monitoring on deploy: After each deployment, closely watch metrics (especially error rates and latencies). Have automated health checks beyond basic – maybe run a quick synthetic transaction (script that does a seat hold and release on a test event) post-deploy to ensure all components working.
	•	Rollback Plan: If a deployment causes severe issues, we have a plan:
	•	If using blue/green, simply revert DNS or load balancer to the old version (which we kept running).
	•	If using rolling deploy and need rollback, use automated rollback in our CI (e.g., ArgoCD, Spinnaker or AWS CodeDeploy can auto-rollback on health check fail).
	•	Database migrations are forward-only, so rollback of code might need to handle that. We avoid destructive migrations. In case a new code expects a new column that was added, if we rollback code, that column being present usually doesn’t break old code (it will ignore it). But if a migration was, say, splitting a column into two, rollback is hard. That’s why we carefully design migrations to not remove or rename critical data in one shot. Ideally use a expand-contract pattern for schema changes (Phase 0 ensures these practices).

Before going live to real users, we likely run a beta with internal users or a small client to test in real conditions. We might simulate a small on-sale (maybe for a free event) to see how the system behaves with a few hundred users, then scale up.

We also prepare Game-day playbooks for incidents:
	•	Redis failure: Steps to failover to replica or restart cluster, how to invalidate locks if needed after recovery, communication plan to users (e.g., tweet or status page “we are pausing ticket sales for X minutes”).
	•	Stripe outage: If Stripe is down, we cannot process payments. We might decide to pause sales (since no one can pay). Have a plan: if Stripe is down > a few minutes during an on-sale, possibly stop issuing new orders or communicate to users. Alternatively, allow users to hold seats longer until Stripe recovers (extend TTL globally).
	•	Postgres failure: If the primary DB fails, Aurora should fail over fast (<30s). The app needs to handle the brief read-only state or errors. We should have a runbook for promoting read replica if needed manually, etc. Also ensure backups are in place in case of data corruption (nightly snapshots, point-in-time recovery enabled).
	•	High latency or partial outage: e.g., one microservice or one context gets slow – use circuit breakers. Although we are mostly monolith, e.g., if Mongo became slow (shouldn’t affect critical path much), we could temporarily disable any calls that wait on it (maybe no layout updates at that moment).
	•	Scaling event: If we see an unexpected surge beyond capacity, have a procedure to quickly add instances or enable the waiting room on the fly to throttle load.

The CI/CD pipeline includes checks for the above conditions and manual approval steps for production deploys, given the high stakes of messing up a live on-sale.

11. Phased Delivery Roadmap

Building a full Ticketmaster-class platform is a significant effort. We will deliver it in phases, providing value early while iterating and hardening features. Below is the roadmap with phases, each with specific milestones, acceptance criteria, and rollback considerations:

Phase 0: Foundations and Safety Nets

Timeframe: Immediately – set up groundwork before feature development.
	•	Infrastructure Setup: Configure dev/test environments, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring stack. Set up initial AWS (or Fly.io) environment, CI runners, etc.
	•	Core Framework Implementation: Establish the DDD structure and Clean Arch layers in the codebase. Define modules for Seating, Ordering, Payments, Catalog contexts, even if empty.
	•	Security & Auth baseline: Implement JWT auth, refresh token mechanism, and secure token storage (Redis). Set up basic user model, login/refresh endpoints working.
	•	Locking Mechanism Prototype: Implement the Redis + Postgres fenced lock pattern for a simple case (maybe a dummy resource). Write a basic SeatLockRepository and test it with concurrent threads to verify no double-acquire. Include the Lua script for multi-lock acquisition and test atomicity.
	•	Outbox & Webhook Framework: Implement the Stripe webhook endpoint to just log events, and the outbox worker skeleton that can pick up events (maybe initially just prints them). Ensure the processed flag concept works with a test event. This sets the stage for actual payment logic later.
	•	Database Migrations System: Set up a migrations tool (Flyway, Liquibase, etc.) and write initial DDL for base tables (users, events, seats, orders, etc., can be stubs). Ensure the pipeline runs migrations and that local devs can apply them easily. Enforce the convention: forward-only, no raw DDL in app code beyond migrations.
	•	Testing harness: Get unit testing frameworks in place, perhaps a first simple test (e.g., test JWT generation/validation, or a test for lock version bump).
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Developer environment up and running (can spin up the app connected to local Postgres/Redis, etc.).
	•	Able to create a test user, obtain a JWT, and call a protected test endpoint successfully.
	•	Able to simulate two parallel lock acquisitions on a fake resource and see that one fails (demonstrating the locking works).
	•	Migrations can be run without errors; CI pipeline passes with sample test.
	•	Rollback Plan: Not much to rollback since this is initial dev. Phase 0 deliverables are not user-facing. If any foundation piece has issues, fix forward (since no prod impact yet).

Phase 1: Core Ticketing MVP

Goal: Deliver the primary purchase flow (hold seats -> create order -> payment -> confirmation) in a single-region environment, with mobile app integration. This is the first end-to-end usable system, albeit minimal.
	•	Seating (Basic): Implement hold and release of seats for a single event:
	•	Seat selection endpoints (/seats/hold, /seats/release) functional with Redis locks and reflecting availability. Initially, might assume a pre-defined event and static seat list loaded.
	•	TTL enforced (could start with a fixed 2 min, extension not yet).
	•	Ordering & Payments (Basic):
	•	Create Order endpoint (POST /orders) creates order in Postgres, calls Stripe to create PaymentIntent (test mode).
	•	Webhook handling: Confirm order on payment success. At this stage, maybe support only immediate success (no refunds or cancel yet).
	•	Ensure on payment success, seats status flips to sold (so they won’t appear available if someone refreshes).
	•	Catalog/Layouts (Basic):
	•	Provide an API to get an event’s seat map. For MVP, we can embed a static JSON or load from Mongo if ready. The layout might be loaded manually rather than an admin UI (we can insert a sample layout doc for a test venue).
	•	Provide an event list or event detail API for the client to pick an event (though MVP could assume one event).
	•	Mobile SDKs & App Integration:
	•	Generate the initial SDKs from the API spec. Integrate them into simple demo apps (maybe not full polished app, but enough to test flows).
	•	Implement in the app: login flow, fetch events, display seat map (could be simple list of seats for now if not graphical), select seats, call hold, then call create order, redirect to Stripe’s UI or use Stripe test card entry.
	•	Receive confirmation (maybe just poll order status if no push yet).
	•	Observability Initial:
	•	Set up basic metrics collection (e.g., number of holds, order creations) and a simple dashboard to monitor during tests.
	•	Logging in place for critical steps.
	•	Testing in Phase 1:
	•	Unit tests covering hold->order->confirm logic.
	•	Integration test using Stripe test webhooks ensuring an order goes to confirmed.
	•	Simulate moderate load (maybe 100 concurrent users) to ensure no obvious issues.
	•	Deliverable: A working end-to-end system in a dev/staging environment where one can:
	•	Create an account, login.
	•	Select an event, view seats, hold some seats.
	•	Purchase the seats (with a Stripe test card) and receive confirmation.
	•	See that those seats can no longer be purchased again.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	At least one on-sale scenario executed in staging with ~100 users or simulated, no double bookings observed.
	•	Mobile app can complete a purchase without manual DB fiddling.
	•	All critical data (order, payment record, audit entry, seat status) is correctly stored and queryable in the DB after the purchase.
	•	Rollback Plan:
	•	This is the first user-facing release (to internal QA or a pilot test). If issues are found (e.g., double-booking bug), since it’s not widely launched, we can pause and fix before any public launch. No “prod rollback” needed as it’s not in prod yet, but if we did deploy to a pilot group and something fails, we can pull the pilot (take system offline) while fixing.

Phase 2: Feature Enhancement and Hardening

Now that the core works, we add important features and improvements for real-world use.
	•	Scale & Caching:
	•	Implement the CDN publishing of seat map: when an event is created or published, push the layout JSON to S3/CloudFront. The /shows/{id}/layout endpoint can then just redirect to the CDN URL. Verify that updates (if any) can purge the CDN.
	•	Introduce caching for event and venue endpoints if needed (they are not high-frequency anyway).
	•	Optimize DB: Add any needed indexes identified in Phase 1 testing. Possibly implement read replicas for load (and adjust code to use replicas for read-only endpoints).
	•	Increase test load to target numbers (or a meaningful percentage) and optimize accordingly (tune Postgres config, etc.).
	•	Extend Anti-Bot & Queue:
	•	Build the waiting room system:
	•	Possibly a simple token bucket: an endpoint /queue/token that either returns “you’re in queue X” or a token to proceed. Or integrate an external library.
	•	Show we can throttle traffic: Simulate 10k users hitting at once with queue enabled, ensure system only lets manageable rate through.
	•	Add Proof-of-Work requirement to /seats/hold (if decided) and implement puzzle verification. Or integrate device attestation checks in the auth layer.
	•	Rate limiting: Implement and configure a rate limit middleware for key endpoints. Test that it blocks excessive calls and resets properly.
	•	Admin and Multi-Tenant Support:
	•	Implement basic admin capabilities: e.g., POST /events to create a new event (with a given venue layout and date), POST /layouts to create a venue layout (upload JSON) – though UI for this might be outside scope, at least provide API for internal use.
	•	Role-based auth: ensure these admin endpoints only accessible to admin users. Possibly integrate with a simple admin web UI for internal ops.
	•	Multi-tenancy: if we have concept of multiple organizations using the platform, enforce tenant isolation in queries (filter by tenant ID in all queries). Test with two dummy tenants that data doesn’t leak.
	•	Order Management and Refunds:
	•	Implement /orders/{id}/cancel fully. Also enable refund via Stripe if order was paid:
	•	Possibly create a small admin endpoint to refund (or reuse cancel for user if within a window).
	•	Handle the Stripe refund webhook (charge.refunded) to mark order refunded.
	•	Implement expiration of pending orders: a background job that cancels orders (and releases seats) if payment didn’t arrive in, say, 15 minutes. This could be part of outbox or a separate scheduler. Test scenario where user abandons at payment - ensure seats eventually free.
	•	Mobile Enhancements:
	•	Improve the seat selection UI (maybe integrate a seat map visualization if available, or at least a grouped list by section).
	•	Add push notification handling in the app: set up Firebase/APNS, and have the server (perhaps in outbox worker after confirming order) send a notification via an external service or FCM API.
	•	Offline ticket storage: after order confirmation, store ticket info (maybe a QR code or just a confirmation that can be shown).
	•	In-app queue UI: handle the waiting room token if returned by API (display queue number, refresh when allowed).
	•	Incorporate attestation if we go that route (these usually involve SDKs on client and sending a token to server).
	•	Observability & Resilience:
	•	Expand metrics coverage to all items listed in section 9. Set up dashboards for key metrics and integrate alerts (maybe not fully in production yet, but test that alerts trigger in staging if thresholds exceeded).
	•	Conduct a simulated chaos test in staging (take down Redis for 1 minute during an on-sale simulation, etc.) and verify system recovers and metrics/logs captured events.
	•	Fine-tune timeouts and retries: e.g., if DB query sometimes takes 1s, maybe increase some timeout if safe, or optimize query. If external calls fail, ensure retries or proper error propagated.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	We can run a full end-to-end rehearsal of a major on-sale event in a staging environment: e.g., 10k users, 5k tickets available, and watch them get sold with proper queueing, no crashes, and metrics within expected bounds.
	•	Anti-bot measures proven effective in tests (e.g., a test script without solving PoW should be much slower or rejected).
	•	A tenant admin can create an event and sell tickets through the system.
	•	No security red flags: run a basic vulnerability scan (static analysis, etc.) and fix issues.
	•	Rollback Plan:
	•	Features like waiting room and PoW are behind flags – if they misbehave in prod (e.g., the queue logic has a bug and people get stuck), we can disable them on the fly.
	•	If multi-tenancy changes somehow cause issues, since code is likely common, we can’t easily disable that, but we’d catch in testing. Worst-case, if Phase 2 has big problems, we could temporarily revert to Phase 1 capabilities (but that would be removing features like queue if they break – acceptable as fallback, just handle load in other ways).
	•	For admin tools, if they are buggy, it only affects internal ops, which we can manage manually as a fallback (e.g., directly insert events in DB if UI fails, until fixed).

Phase 3: Scaling Out and New Business Features

This phase tackles the harder problems of multi-region, secondary markets, and analytics, once the primary market is stable.
	•	Active-Active Multi-Region Deployment:
	•	Stand up a second region (e.g., EU if first was US). Decide on data partition:
	•	Perhaps start with active-passive: try a failover to the new region to test DR.
	•	Then move to active-active: e.g., configure half of events to be served from Region2’s DB. Implement routing logic (could be based on event metadata or user location).
	•	This likely involves setting up separate DB clusters. If using a global DB (Aurora global), test its latency (Aurora global has ~30ms replication lag, which might be okay for cross-Atlantic).
	•	Ensure Redis in both regions (not synced, each region handles its events locks).
	•	Work out how to handle a scenario where an event might get traffic from both sides: ideally route all users for a given event to the same region to avoid cross-region locking, which we ensure via DNS or an application lookup (the event could have a “home region” field).
	•	Data consistency: If a user in Europe wants a ticket for a US event, either they get routed to US region, or if they hit EU cluster, that cluster’s API proxies or uses cross-region query to get data – needs design. We likely say event region = data region.
	•	Implement any needed synchronization for global consistency: e.g., replicate user accounts globally so login works in both, or keep one global auth (maybe continue to have one primary for auth for simplicity).
	•	Thoroughly test region failover: kill one region, ensure traffic seamlessly goes to other (with maybe some performance degradation but not total failure).
	•	Ticket Resale/Transfer Feature:
	•	Allow users to transfer tickets to another user or to list for resale (marketplace).
	•	This adds new domain logic:
	•	Transfer: basically change ownership of a ticket (order line) from user A to B. Could implement as generating a transfer token or just an operation that creates a new order for B (with price $0 if transfer) and mark original as transferred.
	•	Resale: If allowed, user can list their ticket, maybe at a set price, and another user can buy it. This introduces a new order type or linking an order to a previous one.
	•	We’ll likely introduce a Marketplace context with entities like Listing. But since prompt specifically said resale/transfer, we incorporate it in Ordering context or an extension.
	•	Data schema: perhaps an order_line has a field for “transferred_to_order_id” or we create a new order when resale happens linking back. Also need to handle payment from buyer to seller (which might involve Stripe Connect or simpler, all via our Stripe then payout to seller later).
	•	This is complex, but initial support can be limited (maybe only face-value transfers, no dynamic pricing, to keep it simple).
	•	Update mobile app to show “Transfer” options and integrate new endpoints for transferring (maybe via QR code or email link for receiver).
	•	Ensure security around transfers (only allow if enabled, cut-off time perhaps 24h before event).
	•	Reporting Warehouse:
	•	Set up a data pipeline to export data to a warehouse for analytics (like ticket sales reports per event, revenue, etc.).
	•	Could be as simple as a periodic job that dumps certain tables (orders, etc.) to CSV or uses AWS DMS to replicate to Redshift or Snowflake.
	•	Alternatively, use Change Data Capture or read from the audit log/outbox to stream events to a warehouse in near-real-time.
	•	Ensure PII considerations: maybe do not export refresh tokens or sensitive stuff – just business data.
	•	Provide some basic dashboards to organizers (maybe out-of-scope, but having the data available is first step).
	•	Capacity Planning for Scale: At this phase, we should be well above initial targets or at least confident:
	•	Might reevaluate architecture for any single points of failure at extreme scale. For instance, maybe sharding the event_seats table if one instance can’t handle the entire world’s events.
	•	Possibly consider moving some caching to a distributed system like AWS DynamoDB for global consistency of some reference data – only if needed.
	•	Evaluate if the tech stack meets needs or if any component should be replaced/upgraded (e.g., if Mongo performance is an issue, though unlikely given usage).
	•	Compliance & Hardening:
	•	By now, we might be live and need to ensure compliance: do a security audit, performance audit, and address any findings.
	•	Implement any remaining nice-to-haves: e.g., multi-factor auth for admins, better fraud detection (maybe flag if one user buys unusually many tickets).
	•	Prepare documentation and runbooks for customer support (like how to rebook someone if payment succeeded but they didn’t get ticket, etc).
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	The platform successfully operates in at least two regions simultaneously. For example, run an on-sale in EU and US at the same time, each region’s users get their local handling, and failover is tested.
	•	Ticket transfer tested: user A transfers to B, B shows ticket in their app, A’s ticket invalid. For resale, one user lists and another buys, payment flows (likely outside initial Stripe integration scope, but maybe we simulate).
	•	Analytics: able to generate a report of total tickets sold for an event from the warehouse with minimal delay (say within a few minutes of sale).
	•	System meets or exceeds all SLA/SLO: e.g., in a realistic large test, p99 latencies within bounds, no data inconsistencies observed.
	•	Rollback Plan:
	•	Multi-region: If active-active causes issues (like data sync bugs), we can temporarily revert to active-passive (direct all traffic to one region) until fixed. Keep toggles for region routing.
	•	Transfer/resale: If those features have problems, they can be disabled (don’t show in app UI, and reject calls server-side) without affecting core purchase flow.
	•	Warehouse: If causing any load (like CDC affecting DB performance), we can turn it off or throttle it. It’s separate from user-facing operations, so it can be paused if needed without impact to users.

Milestones & Rollback Summary:
	•	Milestone Phase 1: Basic on-sale done internally – Criteria:  Successful test purchase on staging. Rollback: N/A (first build).
	•	Milestone Phase 2: Public MVP launch (maybe for a small event or beta client) – Criteria: Smooth sale of, say, 5,000 tickets with queue and anti-bot working. Rollback: If issues, could take system offline and fulfill manually or postpone sale (in worst case). Because once live, rollback means potentially canceling sales – we mitigate by testing thoroughly and having support staff on standby.
	•	Milestone Phase 3: Scale and feature-complete platform – Criteria: Host a large multi-region on-sale (e.g., 100k tickets across regions) without incident; plus have transfers and reporting functional. Rollback: If a major bug at scale, we might degrade gracefully (e.g., turn off transfers, or funnel everyone to one region if cross-region issues) and then patch quickly.

Throughout, we maintain a risk register and mitigation plans, as detailed next.

Risks and Mitigations

Building and operating this system comes with various risks. Below is our top 10 risk register with mitigation strategies for each:
	1.	Risk: On-Sale Overload (Performance Bottleneck) – During a hugely popular sale, the system might become overwhelmed (DB CPU 100%, or lock contention slows responses, leading to timeouts and unhappy users).
Mitigation: We conduct extensive load testing and use the waiting room to throttle if needed. We will vertically scale the DB for big events and use read replicas and caching for reads. Also optimize critical code paths (prepared statements, efficient data structures). Cloud auto-scaling will add app servers when load increases. We’ll also have a “load shed” strategy: if we start to exceed capacity, temporarily pause new checkouts (with user-friendly messaging) rather than let the system grind. Monitoring will alert us as we approach thresholds so we can intervene (e.g., increase instance counts).
	2.	Risk: Double-Booking due to Concurrency Bug – A flaw in the locking or transaction logic could let two orders book the same seat (the ultimate failure in a ticketing system).
Mitigation: Multiple layers of protection: the Redis lock + Postgres version check is designed to prevent this. We will test all edge cases (like lock expiry just at payment, simultaneous holds on adjacent seats, etc.). The invariant is also enforced at DB level by the unique constraint on seat’s order_id (if we had one) or at least logic that would fail second update. If such a bug is found in testing, we fix before live. In live, if it ever happened, we have audit logs to detect it and can rectify manually (one order would be canceled and refunded). But prevention via design and testing is key.
	3.	Risk: Payment Errors & Financial Issues – Examples: users charged but order not confirmed (money taken, no ticket), or order confirmed without charging (free ticket).
Mitigation: Use the outbox pattern to keep payment and order in sync. The order is only confirmed after we get a Stripe success. If Stripe charges but our confirmation fails (e.g., our DB was down at that moment), the stripe_events record remains unprocessed; when system recovers, it will process and confirm the order. If something still slips through (charged but not confirmed), we can reconcile using Stripe’s dashboard or scripts (matching PaymentIntents to orders) and fix orders post-event. Conversely, order without charge is unlikely with PaymentIntent (if confirmation webhook didn’t come, order stays pending and eventually expires). Additionally, we keep idempotency keys around Stripe calls to avoid double charges on retries.
	4.	Risk: Single Point of Failure - Database – Postgres being the single write master could fail or become a bottleneck.
Mitigation: Use managed DB with high availability (multi-AZ Aurora). Daily backups and PITR enabled. In case of failure, Aurora will failover to a replica in ~30 seconds. Our app will retry queries and has reconnect logic. We also plan for multi-region with possible partitioning to reduce load per DB. In worst failure (region-wide outage), our DR strategy is to bring up environment in another region from replica or latest backup. Also, heavy read operations are offloaded from the primary. Continuous monitoring of DB health (connections, slow queries) helps us react before failure. We can scale up the DB instance size ahead of major events as needed.
	5.	Risk: Redis Failure – If the Redis cluster fails during an on-sale, new seat holds cannot be acquired (and perhaps existing holds can’t be released properly).
Mitigation: Redis is set up with replication (primary/replica) and ideally in-memory persistence if possible to allow quick restart. We can also have a backup Redis instance ready to promote. The application has a circuit breaker: if Redis is unavailable, we quickly fail the hold requests with a clear message (“Ticket reservations temporarily unavailable, please hold on”). This is preferable to hanging. Meanwhile, our ops team would restore Redis (automated failover or manual). Once back, users can retry. We also consider having a lightweight fallback: e.g., as an emergency, allow a direct DB row lock method if Redis is down (less scalable, but something to let a trickle of sales continue in a degraded mode). That fallback can be behind a feature flag. Additionally, we ensure Redis’s own capacity: it’s in-memory so likely it fails only on network or if it crashes – both rare if using managed service.
	6.	Risk: Security Breach (Data Theft or Fraud) – Attackers might try to steal user data, compromise accounts, or cheat the system for tickets.
Mitigation: Multiple measures: All traffic is HTTPS, JWTs prevent session hijacking (and they expire quickly). Refresh token theft is mitigated by rotation and scope (refresh token alone can only get a new JWT, and if reused, gets detected). We store minimal PII, mostly just emails which we hash where appropriate (or at least protect via DB encryption features). We use OWASP best practices in coding (sanitize inputs, use frameworks to avoid XSS/SQLi). We’ll have an external security audit/pen-test before launch. Also monitoring for unusual activities (e.g., many failed logins, token reuse alerts) to respond quickly. In case of a discovered vulnerability, we have an incident response plan: patch quickly (we can deploy fixes fast via CI/CD), possibly invalidate all sessions if needed (force re-login) if a token leak scenario.
	7.	Risk: Bots Still Bypassing Controls – Despite anti-bot measures, sophisticated scalpers might find loopholes (e.g., using real devices/farms, or an undiscovered API endpoint to exploit).
Mitigation: Continuously adapt anti-bot strategies: e.g., if PoW is too easy or someone writes a solver, increase difficulty dynamically. Use behavior analysis: monitor if an account is doing things faster than a human possibly can (then flag or block). Possibly introduce CAPTCHA if we detect non-human patterns (as last resort on certain flows). Collaborate with third-party bot mitigation services (like Cloudflare Bot Management or Kasada) if needed. In the short term, keep some manual oversight for very high-profile sales: e.g., generate reports of top purchasers, anomalies, and be ready to cancel suspicious orders (with refund) if needed. Over time, incorporate learnings from each on-sale (maybe have a retro after each major sale to update our defenses).
	8.	Risk: Feature Creep and Timeline – The scope is large; risk of not delivering on time or introducing too much complexity at once.
Mitigation: Stick to the phased roadmap, which prioritizes core functionality first. Use feature flags to merge work in progress without affecting stable features. Regularly reassess priorities – for example, if resale is too complex to implement by Phase 3 deadline, possibly push it or release a simpler version (like only direct transfer, no marketplace). Also ensure domain boundaries help parallel development (different teams can work on Seating vs Payments with minimal overlap). If timeline is at risk, communicate with stakeholders and possibly stage the rollout (maybe launch primary ticketing first, add resale later).
	9.	Risk: Third-Party Dependency Issues – Stripe could have an outage or slow down, or our email/SMS provider fails, etc., impacting our system.
Mitigation: Always have timeouts and fallbacks for external calls. For Stripe:
	•	If their API to create PaymentIntent is down mid-sale, we might queue order creations until it’s back (not ideal) or switch to a backup PSP if prepared (likely not initially). At least, show a message like “Payments are currently experiencing issues; your reservation will be extended” and extend the hold TTL for affected users.
	•	We maintain contact with Stripe for high-volume events, they often can provide increased capacity or heads-up.
	•	For notifications: if push fails, it’s non-critical (user can poll app). If email fails, we can retry or send later. These don’t block the main flow.
	•	For CDN: If CDN is down (rare), users can still get seatmap from our API directly as fallback (we can build a logic: if CDN link fails, app tries API).
	•	Essentially, design so external failures degrade UX but do not corrupt our internal state.
	•	And consider redundancy: e.g., maybe we have a secondary payment provider for certain events or as backup (beyond initial scope, but an idea).
	10.	Risk: Operational Mistakes – Deploying wrong config (e.g., wrong feature flag setting for an event), or schema migration issues on deploy, etc.
Mitigation: Strict deployment practices: use Infrastructure as Code (so environments are consistent), double-check config for events (we might build an “event config checklist” for each big sale: e.g., ensure waiting room on or off, check inventory loaded correctly, etc.).
	•	Use migrator tools that allow dry-run and have been tested in staging with prod-like data sizes to catch slow migrations. We schedule heavy migrations in off-peak hours and ensure no major schema change right before a big sale.
	•	Have runbooks for common ops: scaling up DB, clearing cache, etc., so operators don’t do ad-hoc steps under pressure.
	•	Backups: before major changes, take a snapshot so we can restore if something goes horribly wrong with data.
	•	Monitoring of deploys: if a new release causes error rate to spike, automated rollback triggers as mentioned.
	•	And of course, thorough QA for each feature. Possibly have a small beta group of users testing new app versions and features in real scenarios before broad release.

By continuously identifying risks and addressing them early (and having contingency plans), we aim to ensure a smooth, secure, and reliable platform launch and operation, delivering a Ticketmaster-class experience without the usual pain points.
