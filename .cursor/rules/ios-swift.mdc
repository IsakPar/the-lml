## How to apply in PR review
- Feature modules follow MVVM + Clean structure with clear boundaries; one public type per file.
- SwiftLint/SwiftFormat enforced; DI used instead of singletons.
- Tests use fast fakes; minimal snapshot tests for stable UI only.
- Platform targets: last two major OS versions; ensure build settings reflect this.
- Offline cache keeps tickets indefinitely; verify logout purges local ticket data.

# Structure
- Feature modules: `FeatureX` with `Domain`, `UseCases`, `ViewModels`, `Views`, `Gateways`.
- One public type per file; internal helpers private.
- SwiftLint + SwiftFormat; avoid singletons except DI container.

# Testing
- XCTest with fast fakes; snapshot tests for UI only when stable.

# Platform & data
- Support last two major OS versions (iOS and Android). Confirm per mobile release.
- Offline cache: retain tickets indefinitely; purge on logout.
