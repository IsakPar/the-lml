## How to apply in PR review
- Commits use Conventional Commits; PR covers one logical change.
- PR checklist complete: tests/docs updated; migrations reviewed; changelog updated if public.
- CI must pass all gates; no skipped tests on main.
- pnpm only: `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm test`; verify TS build locally before push.

# Commits & PRs
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.). One logical change per PR.
- PR checklist: updated tests; updated docs/changelog if userâ€‘visible; migration scripts reviewed.

# CI gates (blockers)
- Build, typecheck, lint, test (coverage thresholds), security audit, and size/dep diff.
- No skipped tests in main. Flaky tests are fixed or quarantined with an issue opened.
 - Package manager: pnpm only. Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm test`.
 - Before pushing/PR: run `pnpm run build` locally and fix TypeScript issues properly (no bypassing).
